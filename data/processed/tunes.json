Bach ( PHH 7 ) in the eighteenth century. The harmonization is taken from his Cantata 80. Many organ and choral works are based on this chorale, including Felix Mendelssohn ( PHH 279 ) in his Symphony and Giacomo Meyerbeer in his opera Les Huguenots . This rhythmic setting needs a more majestic approach than the one found at 468. Sing in harmony on stanzas 2 and 3 and in unison on stanzas 1 and 4. Support the singing with strong accompaniment on the organ and/or with use of a brass ensemble. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1987",

    "notes": "One of the most loved Welsh tunes, HYFRYDOL was composed by Rowland Hugh Prichard (b. Graienyn, near Bala, Merionetshire, Wales, 1811; d. Holywell, Flintshire, Wales, 1887) in 1830 when he was only nineteen. It was published with about forty of his other tunes in his children's hymnal Cyfaill y Cantorion (The Singers' Friend) in 1844. Prichard (sometimes spelled Pritchard) was a textile worker and an amateur musician. He had a good singing voice and was appointed precentor in Graienyn. Many of his tunes were published in Welsh periodicals. In 1880 Prichard became a loom tender's assistant at the Welsh Flannel Manufacturing Company in Holywell. HYFRYDOL (Welsh for \"tuneful\" or \"pleasant\") is often set to Charles Wesley's \"Love Divine, All Loves Excelling\" (568) and William C. Dix's \"Alleluia! Sing to Jesus\" (406). More recently the tune has appeared in several hymnals with Bliss's text. A simple bar form (AAB) tune with the narrow range of a sixth, HYFRYDOL builds to a stunning climax by sequential use of melodic motives. Sing in unison or harmony, and observe one pulse per measure. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1987",

    "notes": "This story is associated with the writing of RATHBUN: One Sunday in 1849 Ithamar Conkey (b. Shutesbury, MA, 1815; d. Elizabeth, NJ, 1867) walked out of the morning service at Central Baptist Church, Norwich, Connecticut, where he was choir director and organist, frustrated because only one soprano from his choir had come that morning. The next Sunday the minister preached a Lenten message on the words of Christ on the cross. One of the hymns to be sung was Bowring's \"In the Cross of Christ I Glory.\" Later that day Conkey's discouragement changed to inspiration, and he composed a new tune for that text. He named the tune after that one faithful soprano, Mrs. Beriah S. Rathbun. The tune was published in Henry W. Greatorex's Collection of Psalm and Hymn Tunes (1851). In 1850 Conkey moved to New York City and became bass soloist at Calvary Episcopal Church. Later he was bass soloist and conductor of the quartet choir at the Madison Avenue Baptist Church. He also sang frequently in oratorio performances. RATHBUN is easily sung in parts. To sense the joy that breathes through the text, do not sing too slowly. Some hymnals set this text to STUTTGART (329), a helpful alternate choice. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "After seeing Gilmore's text in the Boston Watchman and Reflector , William B. Bradbury ( PHH 114 ) composed AUCHTON for those words. Bradbury arranged the text into a stanza/refrain structure, added the final line of the refrain, and published the hymn in his The Golden Censor in 1864. AUCHTON (also known as HE LEADETH ME) means \"unknown.” The tune is a gospel melody in typical verse/refrain pattern; it has a simple harmonization. AUCHTON consists of two main lines formed into an AABB pattern. Sing in harmony. Fermatas, if any are observed, should come at the ends of the lines and not in the middle of line 2, as some soloists prefer. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "The tune HERZLICH TUT MICH VERLANGEN has been associated with Gerhardt's text [\"O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden\"] since they were first published together in 1656. The tune's first association with a sacred text was its attachment in 1913 [sic: should read 1613] to Christoph Knoll's funeral text \"Herzlich tut mich verlangen\" (hence the tune name). It was originally a court song by the great Renaissance composer Hans Leo Hassler (b. Nuremberg, Germany, 1564; d. Frankfurt, Germany, 1612), published in his Lustgarten neuer teutscher Gesäng (1601). Hassler came from a family of famous musicians. He received his early education from his father in Nuremberg, then studied in Venice with Andrea Gabrieli and became friends with Giovanni Gabrieli. In Venice he learned the polychoral style, for which the Gabrielis were justly famous, and brought this practice back with him to Germany. Hassler served as organist and composer for Octavian Fugger, the princely art patron of Augsburg (1585-1601), as director of town music and organist in the Frauenkirche in Nuremberg (1601-1608), and finally as court musician for the Elector of Saxony in Dresden (1608-1612). A Lutheran, Hassler composed for both the Roman Catholic liturgy and for Lutheran churches. Among his many works are two volumes of motets (1591, 1601), a famous collection of court songs, Lustgarten neuer Deutscher Gesang (1601), chorale motets, Psalmen und christliche Gesänge (1607), and a volume of simpler hymn settings, Kirchengesänge, Psalmen und geistliche Lieder (1608). The isorhythmic (all equal rhythms) setting was adapted from one of the harmonizations composed by Johann S. Bach ( PHH 7 ) for his St. Matthew Passion (1729). Many composers have written organ music based on this tune; various melodic and rhythmic versions exist. HERZLICH TUT MICH VERLANGEN (also known as ACH HERR, MICH ARMEN SUNDER; or PASSION CHORALE) is a bar form tune (AAB) with a glorious melody whose beauty has done much to fit the private devotional text onto the lips of congregations. Sing stanzas 1 and 3 in unison and stanza 2 in harmony (possibly unaccompanied with a confident congregation or choir). Keep a subdued registration on the organ and always accompany at a sustained pace. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook 1998",

    "notes": "One of the sturdiest of the some two thousand tunes Daniel Brink Towner (b. Rome, PA, 1850; d. Longwood, MO, 1919) composed, TRUST AND OBEY is also among the most popular. It is cast in the verse-refrain form typical of gospel hymns. Sing in harmony throughout. Though the use of a fermata in the refrain (on. “Jesus\") prevails in some congregations, hymnals, and recordings; the text is one unit and should be performed as one long musical phrase without undue breaths or pauses. Observe one broad beat per measure. Towner was educated musically by his father and later trained by gospel musicians such as George Root ( PHH 93 ) and George Webb ( PHH 559 ). He served as music director for the Centenary Methodist Church Binghamton, New York (1870-1882), the York Street Methodist Church in Cincinnati, Ohio (1882-1884), and briefly at the Union Methodist Church in Covington, Kentucky. In 1885 he joined Dwight L. Moody's evangelistic campaigns as a baritone soloist and choral conductor. From 1893 until his death he was head of the music department of Moody Bible Institute in Chicago, where he strongly influenced several generations of students. Towner compiled fourteen hymn collections. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook",

    "notes": "PUER NOBIS is a melody from a fifteenth-century manuscript from Trier. However, the tune probably dates from an earlier time and may even have folk roots. PUER NOBIS was altered in Spangenberg's Christliches GesangbUchlein (1568), in Petri's famous Piae Cantiones (1582), and again in Praetorius's ( PHH 351 ) Musae Sioniae (Part VI, 1609), which is the basis for the triple-meter version used in the 1987 Psalter Hymnal. Another form of the tune in duple meter is usually called PUER NOBIS NASCITUR. The tune name is taken from the incipit of the original Latin Christmas text, which was translated into German by the mid-sixteenth century as \"Uns ist geborn ein Kindelein,\" and later in English as \"Unto Us a Boy Is Born.\" The harmonization is from the 1902 edition of George R. Woodward's ( PHH 403 ) Cowley Carol Book. PUER NOBIS is a splendid tune in arch form that lifts and then propels itself along to its final note. Try having the choir sing stanzas 1 and 2 in unison. Then all could sing stanzas 3 and 4 in unison with the choir providing the harmony. Stanza 4 could also be sung in canon at one measure, with either a strictly unison accompaniment or one composed to accommodate the canon. All worshipers could sing stanza 5 in unison again. Use a rather light organ registration, but change to a full one for stanza 5. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "Initially Luther used the folk melody associated with his first stanza as the tune for this hymn. Later he composed this new tune for his text. VOM HIMMEL HOCH was first published in Valentin Schumann's Geistliche Lieder in 1539. Johann S. Bach ( PHH 7 ) used Luther's melody in three places in his well-known and loved Christmas Oratorio. VOM HIMMEL HOCH is a simple but spritely melody. Try having either a soloist (with an angelic voice) or a small choir, in harmony and unaccompanied, sing stanzas 1-4. The entire group or congregation could then sing stanza 5 in unison. Add strong accompaniment, possibly using one of the elaborate Bach harmonizations. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "Joseph Parry (b. Merthyr Tydfil, Glamorganshire, Wales, 1841; d. Penarth, Glamorganshire, 1903) was born into a poor but musical family. Although he showed musical gifts at an early age, he was sent to work in the puddling furnaces of a steel mill at the age of nine. His family immigrated to a Welsh settlement in Danville, Pennsylvania, in 1854, where Parry later started a music school. He traveled in the United States and in Wales, performing, studying, and composing music, and he won several Eisteddfodau (singing competition) prizes. Parry studied at the Royal Academy of Music and at Cambridge, where part of his tuition was paid by interested community people who were eager to encourage his talent. From 1873 to 1879 he was professor of music at the Welsh University College in Aberystwyth. After establishing private schools of music in Aberystwyth and in Swan sea, he was lecturer and professor of music at the University College of South Wales in Cardiff (1888-1903) . Parry composed oratorios, cantatas, an opera, orchestral and chamber music, as well as some four hundred hymn tunes. ABERYSTWYTH, Parry's best known hymn tune, was composed in 1876 and named after the Welsh seaside resort where he was teaching. It was first published in Edward Stephen's Ail Llyfr Tonau acEmynau (The Second Book of Tunes and Hymns, 1879) as a setting for the Welsh hymn \"Beth sydd i mi yn byd.\" Parry later joined the tune to “Jesus, Lover of My Soul” ( 578 ), and that combination has remained in most hymnals. Like many Welsh tunes, it requires firm and majestic treatment. The vivid text invites sturdy and sometimes dramatic accompaniment, especially on stanza 2. Try singing stanza 3 or 4 in harmony. For one or two of the other inner stanzas, the congregation may sing in canon when using the alternative accompaniment by Donald Busarow (opposite 17 in the hymnal). The congregation may be divided into two sections, or treble voices could begin, followed by men's voices after one measure. Donald Busarow (b. Racine, Wi, 1934) graduated from Concordia University, River Forest, Illinois, and then studied at the University of Michigan, the Cleveland Institute, and Michigan State University, where he received a Ph.D. degree. Since 1975 he has been professor of music and chair of the department of sacred music at Wittenberg University, Springfield, Ohio. He has published many hymn concertatos, anthems, and organ compositions and is well-known for his hymn festivals. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1998",

    "notes": "NAOMI was a melody that Lowell Mason ( PHH 96 ) brought to the United States from Europe and arranged as a hymn tune; the arrangement was first published in the periodical Occasional Psalm and Hymn Tunes (1836). Some scholars have attributed the original melody to Johann G. Nageli ( PHH 315 ), but there is little evidence to substantiate this claim. The name NAOMI has no specific significance, though Mason did often assign biblical names to his hymn tunes. Sing this typically serviceable Mason tune in parts, possibly unaccompanied, and keep the tempo moving. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "TRURO is an anonymous tune, first published in Thomas Williams's Psalmodia Evangelica, (second vol., 1789) as a setting for Isaac Watts' \"Now to the Lord a noble song.\" Virtually nothing is known about this eighteenth-century British editor of the two-volume Psalmodia Evangelica , a collection of three-part psalm and hymn tunes for \"Churches, Chapels, and Dissenting Meetings in England, Scotland, and Ireland.\" The tune is named for an ancient city in Cornwall, England, famous for its cathedral and for its pottery. TRURO's opening phrase ascends the octave. The entire tune is influenced by George F. Handel's style and bears relationship to similar tunes (see comments at PHH 412 ). Sing stanzas 1 and 5 in unison, stanzas 2-4 in harmony with stanza 4 unaccompanied. Use clear articulation on the organ and a moderate tempo. Try also to frame the singing of this hymn with \"Clap Your Hands\" (166); that rendition would be very fitting for Ascension services. Wren believes that more meditative tunes than TRURO are also appropriate for this text; try the familiar ROCKINGHAM (178). -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook",

    "notes": "LASST UNS ERFREUEN derives its opening line and several other melodic ideas from GENEVAN 68 (68). The tune was first published with the Easter text \"Lasst uns erfreuen herzlich sehr\" in the Jesuit hymnal Ausserlesene Catlwlische Geistliche Kirchengesänge (Cologne, 1623). LASST UNS ERFREUEN appeared in later hymnals with variations in the \"alleluia\" phrases. The setting is by Ralph Vaughan Williams ( PHH 316 ); first published in The English Hymnal (1906), it has become the most popular version of LASST UNS ERFREUEN. In that hymnal the tune was set to Athelstan Riley's \"Ye watchers and ye holy ones\" (thus it is sometimes known as VIGILES ET SANCTI). In this hymn a great text is matched by an equally strong and effective tune. Try these two possibilities of antiphonal singing: divide stanzas between women and men, or assign the verses to one group and the \"alleluias\" to another. Accompanists can signal such antiphonal effects in their use of varied registration. Registration changes also will help interpret the text; for example, the third stanza can begin with a lighter registration and move to a \"blazing\" sound on the second half. Try having the congregation sing some stanzas unaccompanied but add organ (with full stops) at the \"alleluias.\" Or, for a fine effect, have the congregation sing some stanzas in unison with accompaniment and the choir sing the \"alleluias\" in harmony unaccompanied, as indicated in the Psalter Hymnal . It is musically correct and pastorally wise to observe a fermata at the end of the second \"alleluia\" on the second system by turning that half note into a whole note. No ritard is necessary at the end of the hymn; it is built right into the final \"alleluia\" phrase. Try adding instruments to enhance this magnificent tune; there are several fine concertato versions in print that involve trumpets and/or full brass scoring. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook",

    "notes": "TALLIS CANON is one of nine tunes Thomas Tallis ( PHH 62 ) contributed to Matthew Parker's Psalter (around 1561). There it was used as a setting for Psalm 67. In the original tune the melody began in the tenor, followed by the soprano, and featured repeated phrases. Thomas Ravenscroft ( PHH 59 ) published the tune, with the repeat phrases omitted, in his Whole Book of Psalmes (1621). The Ravenscroft version is the setting that virtually all modern hymnals use for this text. TALLIS CANON is a round most congregations can easily sing in two parts, especially when women sing the first part and men sing the second. The congregation could also sing the hymn as a four-part round (each entry at four beats). Try also to sing unaccompanied (organists could sound the first phrase of each entry and then sing along). -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "Ralph Vaughan Williams ( PHH 316 ) composed SINE NOMINE for this text and published it in the English Hymnal in 1906. Vaughan Williams wrote two harmonizations¬–one for unison stanzas and one for choral stanzas. The tune's title means \"without name\" and follows the Renaissance tradition of naming certain compositions \"Sine Nomine\" if they were not settings for preexisting tunes. Equipped with a \"walking\" bass, SINE NOMINE is a glorious marching tune for this great text. Many consider this tune to be among the finest of twentieth-century hymn tunes (it is, perhaps, the cathedral's equivalent to “When the Saints Go Marching In”). Allowing the \"alleluia\" phrase to enter before our expectation of it is a typical and very effective Vaughan Williams touch. Sing the unison and harmony stanzas as given in the Psalter Hymnal . Try assigning the various stanzas to antiphonal groups: a \"heavenly\" ensemble for stanzas 1-2, an \"earthly\" ensemble for stanzas 3 and 5, and the entire congregation on stanzas 4, 6, and 7. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook",

    "notes": "Johann Balthaser König (b. Waltershausen, near Gotha, Germany, 1691; d. Frankfurt, Germany, 1758) composed this tune, which later became associated with Johann Mentzer's hymn \"O dass ich tausend Zungen hätte\" (Oh, That I Had a Thousand Voices). The harmonization is from the Wurttembergische Choralbuch (1653). Music of that time was not notated with bar lines every three or four beats; here a \"quarter bar\" marks the division between the two sections of the first longer phrase, and a full bar line delineates the other phrases. Like many of the German chorales, this tune is in bar form (AAB) and may be sung in four-part harmony. The tune begins on an upbeat, with the first accent on the second note. A chorister in the Kapella of Frankfurt at a young age, König was a student of the famous Georg Philipp Telemann, who later became godfather to König's son. He succeeded Telemann as director of municipal music and became director of music at the Barfiisserkirche and at St. Catherine's Church, all in Frankfurt. In 1727 he also assumed the directorship of the Frankfurt Kapella. Mainly interested in congregational singing, König presented a document to the Frankfurt city council in which he stated the problems of and solutions for the state of singing in the church. He edited the largest eighteenth-century German collection of hymns, Harmonischer Lieder-Schatz (1738), which also included O DASS ICH TAUSEND. This collection consisted of over nineteen hundred tunes with figured bass, including the 125 Genevan tunes set to Lobwasser's German translation of John Calvin's psalter. In accord with the style of his day, König \"straightened out\" (made all quarter notes) the originally lively rhythms of many tunes in this significant hymnal. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "Now often named ST. THEODULPH because of its association with this text, the tune is also known, especially in organ literature, as VALET WILL ICH DIR GEBEN. It was composed by Melchior Teschner (b. Fraustadt [now Wschowa, Poland], Silesia, 1584; d. Oberpritschen, near Fraustadt, 1635) for \"Valet will ich dir geben,\" Valerius Herberger's hymn for the dying. Teschner composed the tune in two five-voice settings, published in the leaflet Ein andächtiges Gebet in 1615. Teschner studied philosophy, theology, and music at the University of Frankfurt an-der-Oder and later studied at the universities of Helmstedt and Wittenberg, Germany. From 1609 until 1614 he served as cantor in the Lutheran church in Fraustadt, and from 1614 until his death he was pastor of the church in Oberpritschen. ST. THEODULPH is a vigorous, bar form (AAB) tune with a strong ascending figure in the opening line. The tune has an exuberance marred only by the low-pitched ending, some congregations may prefer C major. Two harmonizations are provided. The one at 375 by William H. Monk ( PHH 332 ) was first published in Hymns Ancient and Modern (1861). The harmonization at 376 is by Johann S. Bach ( PHH 7 ), taken from his St. John Passion. For either one use a large organ registration, perhaps with brass fanfares/interludes. Try using the fine double descant by Randall De Bruyn (b. Portland, OR, 1947) for stanza 3 with a ritardando at the very end of the stanza (376). De Bruyn attended Lewis and Clark College, Portland, Oregon, and the University of Illinois (M.M. and D.M.A.). Many of his compositions and arrangements have been published by Oregon Catholic Press, where he has been music editor and currently serves as staff composer and arranger. His Traditional Choral Praise (1992) contains at least 160 hymn arrangements for SATB and SAB choirs with vocal and instrumental descants. Many composers have composed organ music on this tune. Hal Hopson's The Singing Bishop , a children's musical based on this hymn, could provide an effective prelude for a Palm Sunday service. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1987",

    "notes": "Edward Miller (b. Norwich, England, 1735; d. Doncaster, Yorkshire, England, 1807) adapted ROCKINGHAM from an earlier tune, TUNEBRIDGE, which had been published in Aaron Williams's A Second Supplement to Psalmody in Miniature (c. 1780). ROCKINGHAM has long associations in Great Britain and North America with Isaac Watts' \"When I Survey the Wondrous Cross\" (384). The tune title refers to a friend and patron of Edward Miller, the Marquis of Rockingham, who served twice as Great Britain's prime minister. Miller's father had made his living laying brick roads, and the young Edward became an apprentice in the same trade. Unhappy with that profession, however, he ran away to the town of Lynn and studied music with Charles Burney, the most prominent music historian of his day. A competent flute and organ player, he was organist at the parish church in Doncaster from 1756 to 1807. Miller was active in the musical life of the Doncaster region and composed keyboard sonatas and church music. His most influential publications were The Psalms of David for the Use of Parish Churches (1790), in which he sought to reform metrical psalmody (and which included ROCKINGHAM), and David's Harp (1805), an important Methodist tunebook issued by Miller with his son. ROCKINGHAM (or ROCKINGHAM OLD) is one of the finest long-meter tunes in the history of church music and is much loved by those who sing in harmony. A slight hold (stretching rather than adding a beat) is appropriate at the end of the second phrase and helps to provide a sense of two long musical lines. Stanzas 4 and 5 need the full resources of organ and other instruments. Keep the music stately and awe-inspiring with respect to the marvelous salvation of which the text sings. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook",

    "notes": "MUNICH has a colorful history. Traces of it run as far back as 1593 in the Dresden, Germany, Gesangbuch in conjunction with the text 'Wir Christenleut.\" A version from a Meiningen Gesangbuch (1693) is still used in Lutheranism for \"O Gott, du frommer Gott.\" Felix Mendelssohn's adaptation of that tune for the quartet \"Cast Thy Burden upon the Lord\" in the oratorio Elijah (1846) is the most recent step in shaping MUNICH as we find it in the Psalter Hymnal and other modern English hymnals. Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy (b. Hamburg, Germany, 1809; d. Leipzig, Germany, 1847) was the son of banker Abraham Mendelssohn and the grandson of philosopher Moses Mendelssohn. His Jewish family became Christian and took the Bartholdy name (name of the estate of Mendelssohn's uncle) when baptized into the Lutheran church. The children all received an excellent musical education. Mendelssohn had his first public performance at the age of nine and by the age of sixteen had written several symphonies. Profoundly influenced by J. S. Bach's music, he conducted a performance of the St. Matthew Passion in 1829 (at age 20!) – the first performance since Bach's death, thus reintroducing Bach to the world. Mendelssohn organized the Domchor in Berlin and founded the Leipzig Conservatory of Music in 1843. Traveling widely, he not only became familiar with various styles of music but also became well known himself in countries other than Germany, especially in England. He left a rich treasury of music: organ and piano works, overtures and incidental music, oratorios (including St. Paul or Elijah and choral works, and symphonies. He harmonized a number of hymn tunes himself, but hymnbook editors also arrange  some of his other tunes into  hymn tunes. Given its geographical roots, we may be fairly confident that the tune is named after the German city Munich, although the city's name in German is München. Like many other chorales, MUNICH is in bar form (AABA'). Try singing it in harmony and possibly unaccompanied on stanza 2 -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "MILES LANE is one of three tunes that are closely associated with this well-known and beloved text; CORONATION is found at 471. Other hymnals also include the more florid DIADEM, composed by James Ellor in 1838 and noted for its elaborate choral harmo¬nization. MILES LANE was published anonymously with Perronet's first stanza in the November 1779 issue of the Gospel Magazine . The tune appeared in three parts with the melody in the middle part. Each \"Crown him\" was meant to be sung by a different part, first by the bass, then by the treble, and finally by the tenor. Thus MILES LANE was a fuguing tune. Stephen Addington identified William Perronet as the composer in his Collection of Psalm Tunes (1780). The tune's title comes from the traditional English corruption of St. Michael's Lane, the London street where the Miles' Lane Meeting House was located, of which Addington was minister. William Shrubsole (b. Canterbury, Kent, England, 1760; d. London, England, 1806) composed MILES LANE when he was only nineteen. A chorister in Canterbury Cathedral from 1770 to 1777, Shrubsole was appointed organist at Bangor Cathedral in 1782. However, he was dismissed in 1783 for associating too closely with religious dissenters. In 1784 he became a music teacher in London and organist at Lady Huntingdon's Spa Fields Chapel, Clerkenwell, a position he retained until his death. Shrubsole is the subject of a famous essay (1943) by Ralph Vaughan Williams ( PHH 316 ): who called MILES LANE a \"superb\" tune and composed a concertato arrangement of it in 1938. Edward Elgar called it \"the finest tune in English hymnody.\" MILES LANE has a wide melodic range and a most effective climax in the refrain, which could benefit from some rubato, especially at the end of stanza 4. Accompany and sing in a majestic manner. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "MACHS MIT MIR was first published in the collection of music Das ander Theil des andern newen Operis Geistlicher Deutscher Lieder (1605) by Bartholomäus Gesius (b. Münchenberg, near Frankfurt, Germany, c. 1555; d. Frankfurt, 1613). A prolific composer, Gesius wrote almost exclusively for the church. Gesius studied theology at the University of Frankfurt and pursued his musical studies privately. He was a cantor in Münchenberg, a private tutor for a poet's family in Muskau, and a cantor at the Marienkirche in Frankfurt from 1593 until his death. He composed numerous settings for pre-Reformation Latin songs and for Reformation hymns (with Luther's hymns well represented) and published them in ten volumes, including his Psalmodia Choralis and Geistliche deutsche Lieder (1601). He also wrote a St. John Passion (1588), a St. Matthew Passion (1613), important settings of the Magnificat (1607), and a theoretical work, Synopsis musicae practicae (1609). Johann H. Schein later adapted Gesius's tune for his own hymn text \"Machs mit mir, Gott\" (1628)–from which the tune got its name–and published it in the second edition of his famous Cantional (1645). [Hymnary ed. note: Schein died in 1630, so someone else published the second edition] Johann S. Bach ( PsH 7 ) used the tune in his St. John Passion (1724) and in his Cantatas 139 and 156. An isorhythmic version of the tune was published in the 1959 Psalter Hymnal under the name EISENACH. Dale Grotenhuis ( PsH 4 ) prepared the harmonization in 1985 for the 1987 Psalter Hymnal. Like so many chorales, MACHS MIT MIR is in bar form (AAB); its rhythms alternate between duple and triple–in this case the use of the two main forms of musical rhythm is a nice way of suggesting that God's providence covers all! Unison singing may be best on the stanzas, with harmonizing optional on the refrain. Sing this tune with much energy to an animating tempo. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook",

The first phrase of this tune is identical to DUKE STREET (412), and that may cause confusion in some congregations. The harmonization is unmistakably African American gospel style, however, and should be accompanied by piano and other instruments including drums (if played on the organ, this tune could be simplified by omitting some of the triplets, especially on the \"Amen\" line). Sing in unison; keep a majestic pace in the style of African American slow-meter hymns. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook",

    "notes": "WINCHESTER OLD is a famous common-meter psalm tune, presumably arranged by George Kirbye (b. Suffolk, England, c. 1560; d. Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England, 1634) from a melody in Christopher Tye's Acts of the Apostles and published in T. Este's The Whole Book of Psalmes (1592) set to Psalm 84. Kirbye was responsible for most of the harmonizations in that psalter. A musician at the estate of Sir Robert Jermyn near Bury St. Edmunds, Kirbye apparently also served as church warden of the local St. Mary's Church and composed several volumes of madrigals that were very popular in his time. WINCHESTER OLD has been associated with Nahum Tate's Christmas text ever since it was published in Hymns Ancient and Modern (1861). The tune title refers to Winchester, an ancient town in Hampshire, England. The song could be sung as a miniature oratorio, with the choir doing the narration (st. 1, 2a, 5), a soloist singing the angel's words (st. 2-4), and on the final stanza (st. 6) the entire congregation becoming the \"throng of angels\" and the choir singing descant–with all the stops pulled out! -- Psalter Hymnal handbook . 1988",

    "notes": "SLANE is an old Irish folk tune associated with the ballad \"With My Love on the Road\" in Patrick W. Joyce's Old Irish Folk Music and Songs (1909). It became a hymn tune when it was arranged by David Evans ( PHH 285 ) and set to the Irish hymn \"Be Thou My Vision\" published in the Church Hymnary (1927). SLANE is named for a hill in County Meath, Ireland, where St. Patrick's lighting of an Easter fire–an act of defiance against the pagan king Loegaire (fifth century)–led to his unlimited freedom to preach the gospel in Ireland. SLANE is an attractive tune with phrases that demonstrate a wide range and creative melodic patterns. The harmonization, one of two settings in The Hymnal 1982, is accessible to good singers (especially to low basses!), but most congregations may prefer unison throughout. Support the singing with rather light but energetic accompaniment. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "During the early 1780s François H. Barthélemon (b. Bordeaux, France, 1741; d. Southwark, Surrey, England, 1808) wrote MORNING HYMN at the request of Jacob Duche, chaplain at the Female Orphan Asylum in London, England. Duche had requested that Barthélemon compose a tune for the well-known morning hymn by Thomas Ken ( PHH 441 ), \"Awake, My Soul.\" The tune was published in A Supplement to the Hymns and Psalms Used at the Asylum or House of Refuge for Female Orphans (undated, but printed between 1785-1789). Born of a French father and Irish mother, Barthélemon had a brief military career in the Irish Brigade after which he studied music on the continent. He moved to London in 1765. There he began a musical career as a composer, especially for opera and ballet, and as an outstanding violinist. A close friend of Joseph Haydn, Barthélemon composed theater music, some concertos, choral and chamber works, and a small amount of church music (some of it for use in the chapel of the Asylum for Female Orphans). Later in life he became interested in the philosopher Emanuel Swedenborg and joined the Swedenborgian Church. Erik Routley ( PHH 31 ) refers to MORNING HYMN as a children's tune, but its mainly stepwise motion and marching rhythms make it accessible to people of all age groups. Sing in parts at a moderate pace. Consider using the better-known WINCHESTER NEW (593) as an alternate tune. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook",

    "notes": "ROYAL OAK is presumably named for a tree at Boscobel, Shropshire, England, in which King Charles II hid during the Battle of Worcester, 1651. A folk song that may well be older than the seventeenth century, ROYAL OAK was associated in the 1600s with the loyalist song \"The Twenty-Ninth of May,\" a song that celebrated the restoration of the monarchy under Charles II on May 29, 1660. Originally found in The Dancing Master (1686), the tune was arranged as a hymn setting by Martin F. Shaw and published in his Song Time (1915). ROYAL OAK is usually associated with the Alexander text in modern hymnals. John Worst (b. Grand Rapids, MI, 1940) prepared the harmonization, first published in the Psalter Hymnal Supplement in 1974. Worst is a composer as well as professor of music at Calvin College, Grand Rapids, a position he has held since 1966. Previously he taught at Dordt College, Sioux Center, Iowa, and the University of Michigan. Educated at Calvin College, Ohio State University, and the University of Michigan (Ph.D.), Worst was an editor of Songs of Rejoicing: Hymns for Worship, Meditation and Praise (1989). He was also one of the contributors to Youth, Electronic Media, and Popular Art and the arranger of the Hymn of the Month , sets 1-4, for Christian Schools International. This light, bright, and energetic tune is well suited to the colorful text. It requires unison singing throughout, although with a few simple changes the refrain could be sung in parts. Use light accompaniment. Try accompanying with guitars, flutes, or recorders, or use just three-part texture on the organ for the stanzas and four-part texture on the refrain. This is a great children's hymn–be sure to have them sing a stanza or two by themselves and then have the congregation join in on the refrain. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook",

    "notes": "Ralph Vaughan Williams ( PHH 316 ) composed SALVE FESTA DIES as a setting for Venantius H. Fortunatus's ( PHH 400 ) famous text \"Hail Thee, Festival Day.\" The tune, whose title comes from the opening words of that text, was published in The English Hymnal of 1906. Like SINE NOMINE (505), this tune is vigorous and jubilant with a rhythmic energy characteristic of Vaughan Williams's hymn tunes. Its broad dimensions and use of triplets may appear formidable, but it is a glorious tune that can be sung in unison by congregations who have good choral and organ leadership. Try singing antiphonally with a choir of children or adults singing the stanzas and the entire congregation singing the refrain. Note how Vaughan Williams has neatly steered the stanzas right back into the refrain without a pause. Accompany with a sense of majesty and strength. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "EASTER HYMN originally appeared in the John Walsh collection Lyra Davidica (1708) as a rather florid tune. Tempered to its present version by John Arnold in his Compleat Psalmodist (1749), EASTER HYMN is now one of the best and most joyous Easter tunes. Composed by Paul Sjolund (b. Minneapolis, MN, 1935), the descant comes from Hymns for the Family of God (1976), which also provides additional parts for two trumpets. A composer, conductor, and festival director, Sjolund has had several hundred of his compositions published. He was minister of music at two Los Angeles churches: Bel Air Presbyterian Church (1959-1968) and La Canada Presbyterian Church (1968-1980). He has also been a consultant and contributor to several modern hymnals. Wonderfully decorating the \"alleluias,\" the melismas add a depth to our praise that spoken \"alleluia\" cannot approximate (and that can be exceeded only by dancing such \"alleluias\"). The structure of text and music invites antiphonal performance. Try having small groups sing Wesley's words and the entire group sing the \"alleluias.\" If the congregation wants to sing the entire hymn–and it often does–organists could point out the antiphonal character by playing the regular lines with a lighter accompaniment or unison melody on some stanzas, and by changing to full organ and/ or harmony for the \"alleluias.\" Be sure to add the descant, especially on stanza 5, perhaps taking that stanza a bit slower. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "NEW BRITAIN (also known as AMAZING GRACE) was originally a folk tune, probably sung slowly with grace notes and melodic embellishments. Typical of the Appalachian tunes from the southern United States, NEW BRITAIN is pentatonic with melodic figures that outline triads. It was first published as a hymn tune in shape notes in Columbian Harmony (1829) to the text \"Arise, my soul, my joyful pow'rs.\" It was first set to \"Amazing Grace\" in William Walker's ( PHH 44 ) Southern Harmony (1835) (see facsimile at p. 85). The setting is from Edwin O. Excell's Make His Praise Glorious (1900). Excell (b. Stark County, OH, 1851; d. Louisville, KY, 1921) grew up in a German Reformed parsonage and worked as a bricklayer as a young man. In 1871 he became a singing school teacher. Soon after, while leading the music and singing solos in a Methodist revival, he experienced a conversion. Excell joined evangelist Sam P. Jones as a song leader, and the two traveled the United States as an evangelistic team. An important figure in the Sunday school movement, Excell wrote over two thousand gospel songs and edited ninety songbooks. He became a very successful publisher of hymn books in Chicago; his company, the Biglow-Main-Excell Company, eventually merged with Hope Publishing Company. Since NEW BRITAIN is pentatonic, it can be sung unaccompanied in a two- or even four-part canon, with groups entering after one or two measures. Sing stanzas 1 and 5 in unison and stanzas 2 and 3 in harmony, and to illustrate the text, try stanza 4 in canon. Use light accompaniment, but consider singing stanza 3 unaccompanied. Some recordings of \"Amazing Grace\" by recent pop singers have cast a sentimental shadow over this hymn, presumably because those performers do not understand the experience of salvation that so amazed Newton. Christians should sing this hymn with some vigor and a moderate tempo that supports their convictions. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook Also see this book: Turner, Steve.

    "notes": "LAND OF REST is an American folk tune with roots in the ballads of northern England and Scotland. It was known throughout the Appalachians; a shape-note version of the tune was published in The Sacred Harp (1844) and titled NEW PROSPECT as the setting for \"O land of rest! for thee I sigh.\" The tune was published again with that same text in J. R. Graves's Little Seraph (Memphis, 1873). The name LAND OF REST derives from the tune's association with that text. The tune was known to Annabel M. Buchanan (b. Groesbeck, TX, 1888; d. Paducah KY, 1983), whose grandmother sang it to her as a child. She harmonized the tune and published it in her Folk Hymns of America (1938), noting similarities between this tune and the tune for \"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot\" (616). Known especially as a musicologist of American folk music, Buchanan was educated at the Landon Conservatory, Dallas, Texas, and the Guilmant Organ School, New York City. She taught at several colleges, including Stonewall Jackson College, Abingdoll, Virginia. Buchanan published numerous articles on folk traditions of the Appalachian area of the United States. She also lectured widely on this topic and gave recitals of folk music. Her own compositions also show the influence of folk music. Like many other folk tunes, LAND OF REST should be sung rather lightly and energetically with two pulses per measure, and faster in a small group. Sing stanzas 1 and 2 in unison (or using a soloist) and stanzas 3 through 5 in harmony. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook",

The tune was first sung on Christmas Day, 1750, in the parish church of Stockport; it was first published in Caleb Ashworth's Collection of Tunes (1760) and then in Wainwright's Collection of Psalm - Tunes, Anthems, Hymns and Chants Collection of Psalm Tunes, Anthems, Hymns and Chants for 1, 2, 3, and 4 Voices in 1766. His sons also became well-known musicians. YORKSHIRE has some marvelous ascending phrases. The second line repeats in the final line with a happy rhythmic change. Try having a small group (a choir or two antiphonal groups) sing stanzas 1 and 2, or begin with a small group and then add singers every two lines. The entire congregation could then sing stanza 3. The hymn also works well as a processional. See 80 for a setting of this tune in the key of B-flat. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "HANKEY has many characteristics of a gospel song: stepwise melodic motion, verse refrain form, and simple harmony. After hearing both hymn texts from Hankey's poems quoted by one of the speakers at an 1867 YMCA convention in Montreal, Quebec, gospel hymn writer William H. Doane ( PHH 473 ) was inspired to set both texts to music. However, Doane's tune for \"I Love to Tell the Story\" was soon replaced by the tune HANKEY by William G. Fischer, who also added a refrain to the original text. The tune set to Hankey's text was published in Joyful Songs (1869) and in many gospel hymnals. The hymn was popularized through its use in the Ira D. Sankey ( PHH 73 ) and Dwight L. Moody crusades. In his youth, Fischer (b. Baltimore, MD, 1835; d. Philadelphia, PA, 1912) developed an interest in music while attending singing schools. His career included working in the book bindery of J. B. Lippencott Publishing Company, teaching music at Girard College, and co-owning a piano business and music store–all in Philadelphia. Fischer eventually became a popular director of music at revival meetings and choral festivals. In 1876 he conducted a thousand-voice choir at the Dwight L. Moody/Ira D. Sankey revival meeting in Philadelphia. Fischer composed some two hundred tunes for Sunday school hymns and gospel songs. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "The authorship of this tune is not clear, with different editors attributing the tune to different composers (or not naming one at all). See the instances list above for the different attributions. From William J. Reynolds, Companion to Baptist Hymnal (1976): \"Nettleton first appeared as a two-part tune in John Wyeth's Repository of Sacred Music, Part Second (1813, p. 112), where it was named Hallelujah. In the Index it is identified as a new tune, and no composer's name is given. The tune has been attributed to some to Asahel Nettleton (1783-1844), a well-known evangelist of the early nineteenth century, who compiled Village Hymns (1825). However, this compilation contained no music, and there is no evidence that Nettleton wrote any tunes during his life . . . It is not known where the tune name first appeared or who was responsible for it.\" (pp. 53-54) The Hymnal Companion to the Lutheran Book of Worship (1981) also notes George Pullen Jackson's observation that the tune is \"one of a group related to the folk melody 'Go tell Aunt Tabby (Aunt Rhody, Aunt Nancy, etc.) her old grey goose is dead.'\" (p. 519)",

Since that publication, the tune has retained its association with this text. The name DIADEMATA is derived from the Greek word for \"crowns.\" The tune is lively and buoyant (though the harmony lacks life, especially the inner voices). Sing a strong unison on stanza 3 if using the Hal H. Hopson ( PHH 219 ) descant. A number of good choral and brass arrangements, useful for festive occasions, are available. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "The popularity of Williams's text (\"Guide me, O thou great Jehovah\") is undoubtedly aided by its association with CWM RHONDDA, composed in 1905 by John Hughes (b. Dowlais, Glamorganshire, Wales, 1873; d. Llantwit Fardre, Wales, 1932) during a church service for a Baptist Cymanfa Ganu (song festival) in Capel Rhondda, Pontypridd, Wales. Hughes received little formal education; at age twelve he was already working as a doorboy at a local mining company in Llantwit Fardre. He eventually became an official in the traffic department of the Great Western Railway. Much of his energy was devoted to the Salem Baptist Church in Pontypridd, where he served as both deacon and precentor. Hughes composed two anthems, a number of Sunday school marches, and a few hymn tunes, of which CWM RHONDDA is universally known. At first widely disseminated in leaflet form, CWM RHONDDA gradually was adopted into various hymnals. The tune is named after the valley of the Rhondda River, a coal mining area in Wales. Though composed with simple melodic means, CWM RHONDDA is a vigorous melody in major tonality (contrary to the popular belief that most Welsh tunes are minor). Sing in harmony. The altos and basses may wish to sing the little notes on the last line as they repeat the words \"evermore,\" \"strength and shield,\" and \"sing to you.\" Accompany in a forceful, confident manner. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook",

    "notes": "GLORIA is the French noel tune traditionally associated with this text. The popularity of this carol stems from its refrain–all those cascading phrases in which human beings imitate the angels' chorus. Try using the refrain by itself as a short choral introit during the Christmas season, perhaps with the Baroque performance practice of dotted rhythms to add a subtle touch of beauty! The repeat of the melody in the refrain permits variation in performance; for example, a small choir in the balcony could sing the first refrain line, and the entire group could join in on the second refrain line (the effect of a few angels beginning the hymn and then being joined by more and more angels). Play with light organ registration until the refrain. The tune is also known as IRIS because of its association with James Montgomery's \"Angels from the Realms of Glory\" (354), which was first printed in the Sheffield Iris (Montgomery, ed.). The harmonization is by Edward S. Barnes (b. Seabright, NJ, 1887; d. Idyllwild, CA, 1958) and was first published in The New Church Hymnal (1937). Barnes studied at the Lawrenceville School, Yale University, and the Schola Cantorum in Paris. He was organist and choirmaster at two New York City churches – Church of the Incarnation and Rutgers Presbyterian – and in Philadelphia at St. Stephen's Episcopal Church. From 1938 to 1954 he served as organist at the First Presbyterian Church in Santa Monica, California. Barnes contributed to the Presbyterian Handbook to the Hymnal (1935) and wrote piano and vocal works as well as anthems and liturgical music. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook See also IRIS . IRIS is very similar to GLORIA, but does indeed have a different contour to the melody.",

    "notes": "An early form of the tune DIX was composed by Conrad Kocher (b. Ditzingen, Wurttemberg, Germany, 1786; d. Stuttgart, Germany, 1872). Trained as a teacher, Kocher moved to St. Petersburg, Russia, to work as a tutor at the age of seventeen. But his love for the music of Haydn and Mozart impelled him to a career in music. He moved back to Germany in 1811, settled in Stuttgart, and remained there for most of his life. The prestigious Cotta music firm published some of his early compositions and sent him to study music in Italy, where he came under the influence of Palestrina's music. In 1821 Kocher founded the School for Sacred Song in Stuttgart, which popularized four-part singing in the churches of that region. He was organist and choir director at the Striftsckirche in Stuttgart from 1827 to 1865. Kocher wrote a treatise on church music, Die Tonkunst in der Kirche (1823), collected a large number of chorales in Zions Harfe (1855), and composed an oratorio, two operas, and some sonatas. William H. Monk ( PHH 332 ) created the current form of DIX by revising and shortening Conrad Kocher's chorale melody for “Treuer Heiland, wir sind hir,” found in Kocher's Stimmen aus den Reiche Gottes (1838). Monk's tune was published with Dix's text in the 1861 edition of Hymns Ancient and Modern, of which Monk was music editor. Dix regretted the use of this tune for his text, but the combination has proven a good match–\"As with Gladness\" is the most popular Epiphany hymn today. DIX is a simple bar form tune (AAB) with a wavelike contour in each of its three lines. Sing in three long lines rather than six short ones in order to reflect the longer phrases of the text. Sing stanzas 14 in unison or in harmony. In stanza 5 add the descant from Sydney H. Nicholson's Royal School of Church Music collection Music for Boys’ Voices (1944). Sydney H. Nicholson (b. St. Marylebone, London, England, 1875; d. Ashford, Kent, England, 1947) was an organist and church music educator who greatly influenced English hymnody. Educated at Oxford's New College, the Royal College of Music in London, and in Frankfurt, Germany, he became organist at several famous cathedrals, including Westminster Abbey (1919-1928). Nicholson founded and administered the School of English Church Music at Chislehurst in 1927; this important institution, with branches throughout the English-speaking world, was renamed the Royal School of Church Music in 1945. Located in Canterbury after World War II, its headquarters were moved to Addington Palace, Croydon, in 1954. Nicholson was music adviser for the 1916 Supplement of Hymns Ancient and Modern and prepared the way for its 1950 edition. He wrote Church Music: a Practical Handbook (1920) and Quires and Places Where They Sing (1932) and composed operettas, anthems, and hymn tunes. In 1938 he was knighted for his contributions to church music. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook",

    "notes": "DIVINUM MYSTERIUM is a plainsong, or chant, associated with the “Divinum mysterium” text in manuscripts dating from the twelfth to fifteenth centuries. The tune was published in triple meter in Theodoricis Petri's Piae Cantiones (1582). Some hymnals retain the dance-like triple meter, while others keep the original unmeasured form of the chant. (It is one of the few chants in the Psalter Hymnal .) Strong wave shapes characterize DIVINUM MYSTERIUM. Sing in unison with the accompaniment preferably played on manuals only. Sing also in speech rhythms, with some freedom in phrasing and tempo–not in the block-chord style of regular meter singing (thus no metronome marking). The accompaniment was composed by Charles Winfred Douglas (b. Oswego, NY, 1867; d. Santa Rosa, CA, 1944), an influential leader in Episcopalian liturgical and musical life. Educated at Syracuse University and St. Andrews Divinity School, Syracuse, New York, he moved to Colorado for his health. There he studied at St. Matthew's Hall, Denver, and founded the Mission of the Transfiguration in Evergreen (1897).   Ordained a priest in the Episcopal Church in 1899, he also studied in France, Germany and England, where he spent time with the Benedictines of Solesmes on the Island of Wight (1903-1906). For much of his life Douglas served as director of music at the Community of St. Mary in Peekskill, New York, and had associations with cathedrals in Denver, Colorado, and Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. He promoted chanting and plainsong in the Episcopal Church through workshops and publications such as The American Psalter (1929), the Plainsong Psalter (1932), and the Monastic Diurnal (1932). His writings include program notes for the Denver Symphony Orchestra, various hymn preludes; organ, as well as the book, Church Music in History and Practice (1937). He was editor of both the Hymnal 1916 and its significant successor, Hymnal 1940 , of the Episcopal Church. Douglas's other achievements include a thorough knowledge of the life and culture of Hopi and Navajo natives, among whom he lived for a number of years. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1987",

    "notes": "George J. Elvey ( PHH 48 ) composed ST. GEORGE'S WINDSOR as a setting for James Montgomery's text \"Hark! The Song of Jubilee,\" with which it was published in Edward H. Thorne's Selection of Psalm and Hymn Tunes (1858). The tune has been associated with Alford's text since publication of the hymn in the 1861 edition of Hymns Ancient and Modern . ST. GEORGE'S WINDSOR is named after the chapel in Windsor, England, where Elvey was organist for forty-seven years. This serviceable Victorian tune is held together by the rhythmic motive of the opening phrase. Sing the opening stanzas in parts, but sing the prayer of stanza 4 in unison. Use of the descant by C. S. Lang ( PHH 253 ) with stanza 4 may suggest a foretaste of heaven's glory. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook",

    "notes": "The tune MONKLAND has a fascinating if complex history. Rooted in a tune for the text \"Fahre fort\" in Johann A. Freylinghausen's ( PHH 34 ) famous hymnal, Geistreiches Gesangbuch (1704), it then was significantly altered by John Antes (b. Frederick, PA, 1740; d. Bristol, England, 1811) in a Moravian manuscript, A Collection of Hymn Tunes (c. 1800). Antes was a missionary, watchmaker, business manager, and composer. Born near the Moravian community of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, he was trained at the Moravian boys' school and later received religious education and further training as a watchmaker in Herrnhut, Germany. From 1770 to 1781 he served as a missionary in Egypt and from 1783 until his death was the business manager of the Moravian community in Fullneck, England. Although music was his avocation, Antes was a fine composer and musician. Among his compositions are a number of anthems, several string trios, and over fifty hymn tunes. MONKLAND received its present shape at the hands of John Lees in another Moravian hymnal, Hymn Tunes of the United Brethren (1824). From there John Wilkes (b. England, date unknown; d. England, 1882) simplified it and introduced it to Henry W. Baker ( PHH 342 ), who published it in the English Hymns Ancient and Modern (1861) to his own harvest-theme text, \"Praise, O Praise Our God and King.\" Wilkes named the tune after the village where he was organist and Baker was vicar–Monkland–located near Leominster in Herefordshire, England. Wilkes died around 1882; he should not be confused with the better-known John Bernard Wilkes (1785-1869). MONKLAND's well-designed melodic contour is a good match for the text. Sing the tune in parts, except on the refrain line, which is appropriately sung in unison. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "The tune SALZBURG, named after the Austrian city made famous by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, was first published anonymously in the nineteenth edition of Praxis Pietatis Melica (1678); in that hymnbook's twenty-fourth edition (1690) the tune was attributed to Jakob Hintze (b. Bernau, Germany, 1622; d. Berlin, Germany, 1702). Partly as a result of the Thirty Years' War and partly to further his musical education, Hintze traveled widely as a youth, including trips to Sweden and Lithuania. In 1659 he settled in Berlin, where he served as court musician to the Elector of Brandenburg from 1666 to 1695. Hintze is known mainly for his editing of the later editions of Johann Crüger's ( PHH 42 ) Praxis Pietatis Melica , to which he contributed some sixty-five of his original tunes. The harmonization by Johann S. Bach ( PHH 7 ) is simplified from his setting in his Choralgesänge (Rejoice in the Lord [231] and The Hymna1 1982 [135] both contain Bach's full harmonization). The tune is a rounded bar form (AABA) easily sung in harmony. But sing the refrain line in unison with full organ registration. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "With the original two-stanza text, AWAY IN A MANGER was first published in James R. Murray's Dainty Songs for Little Lads and Lasses (1887) and initialed “J. R. M.” Murray (b. Andover, MA, 1841; d. Cincinnati, OH, 1905) compiled the songbook and is now thought to be the tune's composer. However, Murray's hymnbook erroneously described this song as: \"Luther's Cradle Hymn. Composed by Martin Luther for his children, and still sung by German mothers to their little ones.\" As a result, the hymn was wrongly attributed to Luther for many years. As a young man taught by such famous music teachers as Lowell Mason ( PHH 96 ), George Root ( PHH 93 ), and William Bradbury ( PHH 114 ), Murray also studied at the Musical Institute in North Reading, Massachusetts. From 1868 until the Chicago fire of 1871 destroyed the company, he edited the Song Messenger for the publishing firm of Root and Cady. He then returned to his birth place, Andover, and taught music in the public schools. From 1881 to 1905 he was an editor for the John Church Company of Cincinnati, an important publisher of church school materials and gospel music, including the monthly Musical Visitor . Murray composed many gospel songs and tunes and compiled a number of church school songbooks that contained his music. AWAY IN A MANGER is a simple tune in ABAC form, probably best performed with light organ accompaniment and/ or with flute, recorder, guitar, or Orff instruments. \"Away in a Manger\" is a fine young children's choir anthem; it could be sung by children alone, with adults humming the harmony. The hymn is suitable for two-part, four-part, or unison singing. Try also to sing unaccompanied. Maintain one pulse per bar. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1987",

    "notes": "In 1899 Finnish composer Jean Sibelius (b. Hameenlina, Tavastehus, Finland, 1865; Jarvenpaa, near Helsingfors, Finland, 1957) wrote a musical score for six historical tableaux in a pageant that celebrated and supported the Finnish press against Russian oppression. In 1900 Sibelius revised the music from the final tableau into FINLANDIA, a tone poem for orchestra. The chorale-like theme that emerges out of the turbulent beginning of this tone poem became the hymn tune. FINLANDIA was first used as a hymn tune in the Scottish Church Hymnary (1927) and the Presbyterian Hymnal (1933). The melody features several repeated and varied melody lines. It is clearly an instrumental tune, but with diligent leadership by organists, congregations can sing the various cadential tones to their proper length. Because of the long lines, accompanists must work to keep the tempo moving. The tune is a glorious setting for harmony singing by choirs. This tune is also often set to the hymn text of Katharina Von Schlegel, \"Stille, mein Wille, dein Jesus hilft siegen\" (\"Be Still, My Soul, The Lord Is On Thy Side\") Sibelius began music studies on the piano, then violin, and at one time thought of becoming a concert violinist. But he began composing at the age of ten, and his later career in music was primarily in composition. Finland's most famous composer, Sibelius used native mythology and geography in his composition, which became a rallying point for Finland's nationalism and patriotism. In 1897 the government awarded him a pension for life for his contribution to his country. From 1900 until the outbreak of World War I he traveled extensively in Europe, often as conductor of his own works. In 1914 he visited the United States, where he was a popular conductor, and where he received an honorary degree from Yale University and taught briefly at the New England Conservatory in Boston. He did not compose during the last twenty-six years of his life. Sibelius is known especially for his symphonic music, but he also composed many songs and theater music, as well as music for piano and chamber ensembles. His only compositions for devotional use are Five Christmas Songs (1895-1913) and \"You Are Mighty, a Lord\" (1927) for mixed choir. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook",

    "notes": "JUDAS MACCABEUS is an arrangement of a tune from the chorus \"See, the Conquering Hero Comes\" in Handel's oratorio Judas Maccabeus (first performed without this chorus in 1746). Handel initially used the tune in his oratorio Joshua (1747) but transferred it to Judas Maccabeus in 1751; such changes were common in Handel's operas and oratorios. Handel is reported to have said to a friend, \"you will live to see it [the tune] a greater favorite with the people than my other finer things.\" The tune's first appearance in a hymnal was probably in Thomas Butts's Harmonia Sacra (around 1760) where it was set to Charles Wesley's \"Christ the Lord Is Risen Today\" (388). This melody, also known as MACCABEUS, is the setting for Edmond Budry's Easter text \"A toi la gloire\" (\"Thine Be the Glory\") in a number of modern hymnals. Including the refrain, JUDAS MACCABEUS is cast in a rounded bar form (AABA). Sing in unison or in parts. This tune merits the use of trumpets or a brass ensemble in addition to festive, crisp articulation of organ tones. Georg Friederich Handel (b. Halle, Germany, 1685; d. London, England, 1759) became a musician and composer despite objections from his father, who wanted him to become a lawyer. Handel studied music with Zachau, organist at the Halle Cathedral, and became an accomplished violinist and keyboard performer. He traveled and studied in Italy for some time and then settled permanently in England in 1713. Although he wrote a large number of instrumental works, he is known mainly for his Italian operas, oratorios (including Messiah , 1741), various anthems for church and royal festivities, and organ concertos, which he interpolated into his oratorio performances. He composed only three hymn tunes, one of which (GOPSAL) still appears in some modern hymnals. A number of hymnal editors, including Lowell Mason ( PHH 96 ), took themes from some of Handel's oratorios and turned them into hymn tunes (see ANTIOCH, 337). -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "The anonymous tune FOUNDATION first appeared in Joseph Funk's A Compilation of Genuine Church Music (1832) as a setting for this text (there it was called PROTECTION). The tune was also published with the text in Southern Harmony and Sacred Harp. The ancestors of Joseph Funk (b. Lancaster County, PA, 1778; d. Mountain Valley, a.k.a. Singers Glen, VA, 1862) were German Mennonites who had settled in eastern Pennsylvania. Around 1780 the Funk family moved to the Shenandoah Valley close to Harrisonburg, Virginia. Funk became a farmer and a teacher in a schoolhouse on his property. An itinerant singing-school teacher and music publisher, he also issued the monthly music journal Southern Musical Advocate and Singer's Friend before the Civil War (the journal was continued later by his sons). Funk published Choral-Music (1816) and A Compilation of Genuine Church Music (1832). The revised twenty-fourth edition (1980) is still in use by Mennonites in the Shenandoah Valley today. Funk's life was the focus of Alice Parker's opera Singers Glen (1978). The harmonization is by Dale Grotenhuis ( PHH 4 ). There are several options for singing: congregation throughout, soloists on the middle stanzas, or in canon. Like many folk tunes, FOUNDATION is pentatonic and should be sung with vigor. It can be sung either in two-part canon (two measures apart) or in four parts (one measure apart). Try having the choir's men and women sing in canon on the inner stanzas, perhaps following a soloist. For the final stanza, try dividing the entire congregation into four groups for a stirring conclusion. When singing in canon, sing unaccompanied or use the Busarow settings for canon in All Praise to You, Eternal God (Augsburg, 1980), do not use the hymnal accompaniment. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1987 The above information is incorrect and incomplete. This tune occurs (under the name CHRISTIAN'S FAREWELL, #334) in the Southern Harmony , but not with this text. Rather, its first line there is \"Farewell, my dear brethren, the time is at hand\". \"How firm a foundation\" appears twice in the Southern Harmony , but the tunes are SINCERITY (#101) and SOLICITUDE (#69). In the Sacred Harp , \"How firm a foundation\" is set to this tune, but the tune name is BELLEVUE. (note by User Haruo added June 7, 2011)",

In the Psalter Hymnal the tune is in isorhythmic form (all equal rhythms) and has a harmonization that was published in Thomas Ravenscroft's ( PHH 59 ) Whole Booke of Psalmes (1621). The tune's name comes from the city of Dundee, known as the \"Scottish Geneva\" during the era of the Scottish Reformation. DUNDEE fits the meditative character of the text; its smooth lines invite part singing. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook",

The tune is also known as ZUNDEL. Approximating the shape of a rounded bar form (AA'BA'), BEECHER is a strong tune with clean rhythms that should be sung in harmony and with solid organ support (st. 4 needs more modesty). After receiving an education in Germany, Zundel (b. Hochdorf, Germany, 1815; d. Cannstadt, Germany, 1882) went to St. Petersburg, Russia, where he served as organist of St. Anne Lutheran Church and was bandmaster of the imperial horse guards. He came to New York in 1847 and became the organist at Plymouth Congregational Church in Brooklyn (1850-1878). Henry Ward Beecher, the famous abolitionist preacher, was pastor of that congregation, and their joint ministry caused the Plymouth Church to become well known for its preaching, organ playing, and congregational singing. Dissatisfied with existing hymnals, Beecher asked Zundel to help compile several new hymnals. Temple Melodies (1851) and the Plymouth Collection of Hymns (1855) were the result. Zundel provided twenty-eight hymns tunes for the Plymouth Collection . He also published The Choral Friend (1855), Psalmody (1855), and Christian Heart Songs, and he edited the Monthly Choir and Organ Journal until his retirement in Germany in 1880. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "George William Martin (b. London, England, 1825; d. London, 1881) composed LEOMINSTER, named for a town in the county of Hereford and Worcester (formerly Herefordshire), England. The tune was first published in The Journal of Part Music (vol. 2, 1862), in which it was titled THE PILGRIM'S SONG. Martin was editor of that publica¬tion from 1861 to 1862. As a boy Martin was a chorister in St. Patrick's Cathedral. He taught music at the Normal College for Army Schoolmasters in Chelsea and at St. John's Training College in Battersea. In 1849 he became organist at Christ Church, Battersea. Well-known for his skill in training children's choirs, Martin also conducted mass choirs, such as the Metropolitan Schools Choral Society. He composed glees, madrigals, and part-songs, and edited oratorios of Handel and Haydn. Arthur S. Sullivan ( PHH 46 ) later arranged and harmonized the tune and labeled it as an \"Old Melody\" in his Church Hymns with Tunes (1874). LEOMINSTER's many repeated tones in lines 1 and 3 give way to the more dramatic shape oflines 2 and 4. The tune's simplicity allows for bringing in harmony, perhaps with stanza 2 unaccompanied. Accompany stanza 3 with a bright and strong organ registration. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "Derived from the fourth piano piece in Robert A. Schumann's Nachtstücke , Opus 23 (1839), CANONBURY first appeared as a hymn tune in J. Ireland Tucker's Hymnal with Tunes, Old and New (1872). The tune, whose title refers to a street and square in Islington, London, England, is often matched to Havergal's text. CANONBURY has a simple binary form, which consists of two versions of the same long melody. Sing in parts, ideally with a sense of two long lines rather than four choppy phrases, possibly with a fermata at the end of the first long line. Robert Schumann (b. Zwickau, Saxony, Germany, 1810; d. Endenich, near Bonn, Germany, 1856) wrote no hymn tunes himself, though a few of his lyrical melodies were adapted into hymn tunes by hymnal editors. One of the greatest musicians of the Romantic period, Schumann did not at first seem destined for a musical career. Although he was a precocious piano player, his mother and his guardian insisted that he study for a legal career. From 1828 to 1830 he studied law at Leipzig and Heidelberg Universities, but much of his time was consumed with music and poetry. From 1830 until his death Schumann devoted his life to music. After a finger injury terminated his concert career as a pianist in 1832, he turned completely to composition. Schumann composed successfully in many genres but became especially famous for his piano works and song cycles. In 1840 he married Clara Wieck, whom he had known since 1828; she was a famous pianist and composer in her own right who inspired many of Schumann's songs. He suffered from depression for much of his adult life and in 1854 after an unsuccessful suicide attempt, was admitted to a mental institution, where he later died. Schumann founded the magazine Neue Zeitschrift für Musik and edited it for ten years. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

Observe a moderate pace for the slow-moving harmony. ASSURANCE is one of the several tunes composed for Crosby’s text by Phoebe Palmer Knapp (b. New York, NY, 1839; d. Poland Springs, ME, 1908). As a young girl Knapp displayed great musical talent; she composed and sang children’s song at an early age. The daughter of the Methodist evangelist Walter C. Palmer, she was married to John Fairfield Knapp at the age of sixteen. She was a founder of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, and after her husband’s death shared her considerable inherited wealth with various charitable organizations. She composed over five hundred gospel songs, of which the tunes for “Blessed Assurance” and “Open the Gates of the Temple” are still popular today. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "JESU JOY is a form of the tune WERDE MUNTER, MEIN GEMUETE by Johann Schop (b. Hamburg [?], Germany, c. 1595; d. Hamburg, 1667). In 1614 Schop was appointed court musician in the Hofkapelle at Wolfenbüttel. A virtuoso violinist, he also played the lute, cornetto, and trombone. He became a musician for King Christian IV of Denmark in Copenhagen in 1618. When the plague swept through Copenhagen, Schop fled to find employment elsewhere. In 1621 he settled in Hamburg, where he became the principal violinist for the city and organist at St. James Church. Exposed to various national music styles in Hamburg and in his travels, Schop became a cosmopolitan composer, well known for his dance suites, church concertos, and songs. He composed forty-nine new melodies for Johann Rist's Himmlische Lieder (1641-1643), including WERDE MUNTER (1642). The melody gained popularity through Johann S. Bach's ( PHH 7 ) famous harmonization of the tune in his Cantata No. 147 (1723). JESU JOY is a rounded bar form (AABA'). In communities where this tune is well known, it would be delightful to use the Bach organ arrangement as introduction, interlude (between the two stanzas), and postlude to the singing of the psalm; Bach's setting is in G major, and the hymnal setting is in F, so one or the other needs to be transposed to combine them. A song leader can conduct the entrances for the congregation. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook",

    "notes": "GENEVAN 68 is usually attributed to Matthäus Greiter (b. Aichach, Bavaria, 1490; d. Strasbourg, France, 1550). It was published as a setting for Psalm 119 in Das dritt theil Strassburger Kirchenampt (1525), which Greiter and his friend Wolfgang Dachstein edited. Greiter studied at Freiburg University and became a monk and musician at the Strassburg Cathedral. Influenced by Wolfgang Dachstein, Greiter joined the Lutheran Church in 1524 and served several Lutheran congregations in the Strassburg area. He also taught at the Gymnasium Argentinense (high school) and eventually directed a choir school. However, the year before his death Greiter returned to the Roman Catholic Church. He is thought to have been the music editor of John Calvin's first Strasbourg Psalter, Aulcuns Pseaulmes et Cantiques (1539). Greiter's tune was later published with Psalm 36 in the 1539 Strasbourg Psalter approved by John Calvin for worship in Geneva, and still later with Psalm 68 in the 1562 edition of the Genevan Psalter. This sturdy tune is known among Lutherans as O MENSCH BEWEIN' and in the British tradition (with alterations) as OLD 113TH. Written in the Ionian (major) mode, GENEVAN 68 became the battle song of the Calvinist Reformation throughout Europe (analogous to Luther's \"A Mighty Fortress Is Our God\" in the Lutheran tradition). It has been called the \"Huguenot Marseillaise,\" and stanzas 1 and 6 (1 and 10 in the old Dutch versification) are probably the best known in the Dutch Reformed tradition. The melody consists of four long phrases shaped into a bar form (AABC). Its first phrase is identical to the first phrase of LASST UNS ERFREUEN (431). Two harmonizations are given–one composed in 1985 by Howard Slenk ( PHH 3 ), and the 1564 setting (opposite 67 in the hymnal) by Claude Goudimel ( PHH 19 ) with the melody in the tenor, which was typical of that time. GENEVAN 68 is a fine processional tune requiring a stately tempo. Antiphonal singing is best for the entire psalm; try this pattern, alternating accompaniment as well: Everyone: stanzas 1 and 9 Group A: stanzas 2, 4, 6, and 8 Group B: stanzas 3, 5, and 7 -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "After various tunes had been set to this text, Gladden insisted on the use of MARYTON. Composed by H. Percy Smith (b. Malta, 1825; d. Bournemouth, Hampshire, England, 1898), the tune was originally published as a setting for John Keble's \"Sun of My Soul\" in Arthur S. Sullivan's Church Hymns with Tunes (1874). Henry Percy Smith was educated at Balliol College, Oxford, England, and ordained a priest in the Church of England in 1850. He served five churches, including St. Michael's York Town in Farnborough (1851-1868), Great Barton in Suffolk (1868-¬1882), Christ Church in Cannes, France (1882-1892), and the Cathedral in Gibraltar (1892-1898). MARYTON is his only tune found in contemporary hymnals and is thought to be the only tune he published. MARYTON is a serviceable but generic nineteenth-century hymn tune; its wide-ranged melody reaches a high point in the middle phrases. Sing the first and final stanzas in unison and the middle stanzas in parts. Because textual and musical phrases are often at odds with each other in this hymn, a competent choir may aid the singing by following the punctuation and not breathing in the middle of textual phrases. Keep the tempo moving! -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook",

    "notes": "STUTTGART was included in Psalmodia Sacra (1715), one of the most significant hymnals of the early sixteenth century [sic: eighteenth century]. Christian F. Witt (b. Altenburg, Germany, e. 1660; d. Altenburg, 1716) was an editor and compiler of that collection; about 100 (of the 774) tunes in that collection are considered to be composed by him, including STUTTGART, which was set to the text \"Sollt' es gleich.\" Witt was chamber organist and later Kapellmeister at the Gotha court. He composed vocal and instrumental music, including some sixty-five cantatas. The tune title STUTTGART relates to a story about Rev. C. A. Dann's banishment from his pulpit at St. Leonard's Church in Stuttgart in the early nineteenth century. When Dann was eventually invited back to his church, his congregation greeted him with the singing of \"Sollt' es gleich.\" Henry J. Gauntlett ( PHH 104 ) put the tune into its present isorhythmic (all equal rhythms) form for Hymns Ancient and Modern (1861). A simple tune of two long lines and a number of repeated tones, STUTTGART has true congregational appeal. This tune has been traditionally used for \"Come, Thou Long-Expected Jesus.\" Sing the hymn in harmony in a broad tempo. Or try singing stanza 3 unaccompanied and in parts, and stanza 4 in unison with alternate harmonization or with the descant (1983) by John Wilson (278). Use clear articulation on the organ with cheerful stops. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1998",

The tune was published in English Country Songs [sic: English County Songs] (1893), an anthology compiled by Lucy E. Broadwood and J. A. Fuller Maitland. After having heard the tune in Kingsfold, Sussex, England (thus its name), Ralph Vaughan Williams ( PHH 316 ) introduced it as a hymn tune in The English Hymnal (1906) as a setting for Horatius Bonar's \"I Heard the Voice of Jesus Say\" (488). Shaped in classic rounded bar form (AABA), KINGSFOLD has modal character and is both dignified and strong. It is well suited to either unison or harmony singing. Use bright organ tone. Try playing on two manuals and pedal on the middle stanzas. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "Robert Jackson (b, Oldham, Lancashire, England, 1842; d. Oldham, 1914) originally, composed TRENTHAM as a setting for Henry W. Baker's \"O Perfect Life of Love\" (380). Named for a village in Staffordshire, England, close to the town in which Jackson was born, the tune was published with the Baker text in Fifty Sacred Leaflets (1888). After receiving his musical training at the Royal Academy of Music, Jackson worked briefly as organist at St. Mark's Church, Grosvenor Square, in London. But he spent most of his life as organist at St. Peter's Church in Oldham (1868-1914), where his father had previously been organist for forty-eight years. A composer of hymn tunes, Jackson was also the conductor of the Oldham Music Society and Werneth Vocal Society. By the turn of the twentieth century, TRENTHAM became associated with the Hatch text. TRENTHAM is a serviceable tune in the mannerist tradition of Victorian hymnody (see PHH 276 ), but it is barely adequate for the fervor of this text. Nonetheless, the tune is loved by many. Sing in harmony and maintain one pulse per bar. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "LLANFAIR is usually attributed to Welsh singer Robert Williams (b. Mynydd Ithel, Anglesey, Wales, 1781; d. Mynydd Ithel, 1821), whose manuscript, dated July 14, 1817, included the tune. Williams lived on the island of Anglesey. A basket weaver with great innate musical ability, Williams, who was blind, could write out a tune after hearing it just once. He sang hymns at public occasions and was a composer of hymn tunes. LLANFAIR was first published with a harmonization by John Roberts in John Parry's Peroriaeth Hyfryd (Sweet Music) (1837). The tune has been associated with the Wesley/Cotterill text since its publication with the text in The English Hymnal (1906). LLANFAIR is actually a common Welsh name, but some scholars believe that in this case the tune's name refers to the Montgomery County [sic Anglesey County] village in Wales where Williams was born. A rounded bar form (AABA) tune, LLANFAIR features the common Welsh device of building a melody on the tones of the tonic triad. The tune is in a major key (not all Welsh tunes are in minor keys!). The melismas give fitting shape to the \"alleluias.\" Use brisk accompaniment for this cheerful tune. LLANFAIR has a similar pattern to that of EASTER HYMN (388); see suggestions there for antiphonal style performance. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "The tune is from the second chorus of Felix Mendelssohn's ( PHH 279 ) Festgesang (Op. 68) for male voices and brass; it was first performed in 1840 at the Gutenberg Festival in Leipzig, a festival celebrating the anniversary of Gutenberg's invention of the printing press. Mendelssohn's tune is similar to another that appeared one hundred years earlier in 'The Song of Mars\" from the John Pepusch opera Venus and Adonis. Mendelssohn once wrote of this music, \"It will never do to sacred words.\" William H. Cummings (b. Sidbury, Devonshire, England, 1831; d. Dulwich, London, England, 1915) may not have been aware of Mendelssohn’s opinion; he adapted the tune to Wesley's text in 1856. When they were placed together in Hymns Ancient and Modern (1861), \"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing\" became a very popular hymn. Cummings had a lifelong love of Felix Mendelssohn, sparked when he sang at age sixteen in the first London performance of Elijah , which was directed by Mendelssohn himself. As a young boy, Cummings had been a chorister at St. Paul's Cathedral and later sang in the choirs of the Temple Church, Westminster Abbey, and the Chapel Royal. Cummings became a famous tenor–he sang in oratorios and was especially known for his evangelist role in the Bach passions. He taught voice at the Royal Academy of Music and the Royal Normal College and School for the Blind in London and was also an accomplished organist. Cummings wrote books and articles on music history, wrote a biography of Henry Purcell and edited his music, and composed many choral pieces. MENDELSSOHN is an excellent match for Wesley's text. It is a rousing tune, even martial in some of its phrases. Sing with lots of enthusiasm; do not drown out the stanzas with too much organ–save that extra stop for the refrain and the final stanza. Let the final stanza soar with the descant and the alternate harmonization by David Willcocks (b. Newquay, England, 1919), published in Carols for Choir 1 (1961). Willcocks has had a highly distinguished musical career. A chorister at Westminster Abbey, he continued his education at Clifton College, the Royal College of Music, and King's College, Cambridge, England. He was organist of Worcester Cathedral (1950-1957) and conductor of the Bradford Festival Choral Society (1955-1974). Under his leader¬ship as director of music and organist of King's College, Cambridge, from 1957 to 1974, the King's College Choir began a series of recordings which, among other repertoires, made famous the annual Festival of Lessons and Carols. Beginning in 1960 Willcocks conducted the Bach Choir of London, and in 1973 he became director of the Royal College of Music. Mainly a composer of church music, Willcocks has also made arrangements of carols, many of which were published in the various Oxford's Carols for Choirs publications. He makes frequent trips to North America for choral festivals. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook",

Reynolds, in his Companion to Baptist Hymnal (1976), p. 161, wrote as follows: Happy Day appeared in William McDonald’s Wesleyan Sacred Harp (Boston, 1854), set to “Jesus, my All, to heaven is gone” with the present refrain, \"Happy day, happy day, When Jesus washed my sins away!\" Doddridge’s hymn was given as an alternate text. It is quite possible that the tune was known prior to this date and appeared in earlier collections. McCutchan indicates that the hymn tune refrain is from a song by Edward F. Rimbault, entitled “Happy Land.” More than likely the rest of the tune was the work of some anonymous musician or musicians.",

    "notes": "William Croft (b. Nether Ettington, Warwickshire, England, 1678; d. Bath, Somerset, England, 1727) was a boy chorister in the Chapel Royal in London and then an organist at St. Anne's, Soho. Later he became organist, composer, and master of the children of the Chapel Royal, and eventually organist at Westminster Abbey. His duties at the Chapel Royal were expanded in 1715 to include teaching boys reading, writing, and arithmetic, as well as composition and organ playing. Croft published a two-volume collection of his church music, Musica sacra (1724), in one score rather than in separate part books, and in his preface encouraged others to do likewise. He contributed psalm tunes to The Divine Companion (1707) and to the Supplement to the New Version of Psalms by Dr. Brady and Mr. Tate (1708), which included HANOVER. These tunes mark a new development in English psalm tunes. HANOVER was printed anonymously, but William Croft is generally credited with its composition. The name derives from the House of Hanover, the family of King George III. HANOVER is a well-crafted tune, distinguished in part by its triple meter, which was still rare in hymn tunes in the early eighteenth century. Like the music of its immediate neighbors, Psalms 148 and 150, which also begin and end with hallelujahs, HANOVER calls for the full resources of voices and organ and other instruments. It should be sung in harmony throughout–or try harmony on the first three stanzas and unison voices and the descant on the final stanza to provide a strong conclusion to this powerful psalm. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

Set to \"Mercy, O Thou Son of David,\" the tune was published in William Walker's ( PHH 44 ) Southern Harmony (1835) with the title RESTORATION. Its name was changed to ARISE (after the refrain in the ballad about the prodigal son) when it was set to Hart's text. Like many folk tunes, ARISE is pentatonic and could be sung in two-part canon (at one measure), but then the accompaniment should not be used. Sing in unison on stanza 1, with the choir in canon on stanza 2. Try having the entire group sing in harmony on stanzas 3 and 4. When singing and accompanying, be sure to retain the sturdiness of this folk melody. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "Originally a folk song (\"Sollen nun die grünen Jahre\") dating from around 1700, O DU LIEBE MEINER LIEBE was used as a hymn tune in the Catholic hymnal Bambergisches Gesangbuch (1732). The tune name is the incipit of the text to which it was set in Johann Thommen's Erbaulicher Musicalischer Christen-Schatz oder 500 Geistliche Lieder (1745). The Psalter Hymnal version is from a manuscript chorale book of the Moravian Brethren compiled in Herrnhut in 1735. The tune is a rounded bar form (AABA) with simple stepwise melodic motion. Sing in harmony. Another harmonization in G major (see 513) could provide an alternative setting, perhaps for a higher and fuller sound on stanza 4. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "Converted to Christianity as a youth at a mission in Buffalo, New York, Marcus Morris Wells (b. Cooperstown, NY, 1815; d. Hartwick, NY, 1895) spent most of his life near Hartwick as a farmer and maker of farm implements. He is remembered in hymnody for writing both the text and tune of \"Holy Spirit, Faithful Guide.\" \"On a Saturday afternoon, October 1858, while at work in my cornfield, the sentiment of the hymn came to me,\" writes Wells. \"The next day, Sunday, being a very stormy day, I finished the hymn and wrote the tune for it and sent it to Prof. I. B. Woodbury.\" Isaac Woodbury was the editor of the New York Musical Pioneer , and the original text and tune were first published in that periodical's November 1858 issue. GUIDE has been associated with Psalm 121 since the 1887 Psalter . GUIDE is a rounded bar form (AABA); it has basically one rhythmic pattern and a very simple harmony. One antiphonal arrangement that works nicely is to have a soloist ask the opening question and everyone sing the rest in reply. The tune's simplicity invites unaccompanied singing in harmony. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "The tune CREATION is taken from the chorus “The Heavens Are Telling” from the well known oratorio The Creation (1798) by Franz Joseph Haydn (b. Rohrau, Austria, 1732; d. Vienna, Austria, 1809). Haydn's life was relatively uneventful, but his artistic legacy was truly astounding. He began his musical career as a choirboy in St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna, spent some years in that city making a precarious living as a music teacher and composer, and then served as music director for the Esterhazy family from 1761 to 1790. Haydn became a most productive and widely respected composer of symphonies, chamber music, and piano sonatas. In his retirement years he took two extended tours to England, which resulted in his \"London\" symphonies and (because of G. F. Handel's influence) in oratorios. Haydn's church music includes six great Masses and a few original hymn tunes. Hymnal editors have also arranged hymn tunes from various themes in Haydn's music. William Gardiner ( PHH 111 ) altered CREATION to long-meter double in 1812; it was published in its present form in 1848 in Mason and Webb's The National Psalmist . CREATION is essentially a bar form (AABB') with a harmony well-suited to part singing; take it on a half-note pulse. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

Like most modern hymnals, the Psalter Hymnal prints the isorhythmic (all equal rhythms) version. The tune was used by Johann S. Bach ( PHH 7 ) in his cantatas 79 and 192 and by Felix Mendelssohn ( PHH 279 ) in the Lobgesang movement of his Symphony No.2 (1840); the harmonization is based on the one in six voices by Mendelssohn in that work. There are also many organ compositions based on NUN DANKET. A bar form (AAB), NUN DANKET is a splendid tune for majestic occasions of thanksgiving. Sing stanzas 1 and 2 in either unison or harmony, but sing the doxology in stanza 3 in unison, preferably with a descant. Observe a fermata at the ends of the first two systems. This tune needs a broad tempo. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

The tune was published in the Hymnal with Music as Used in Trinity Church (1893), a hymnal compiled by Messiter during his long term of service as organist/ choirmaster at Trinity Church (Episcopal) in New York City (1866-1897). Educated by private tutors in England, Messiter immigrated to the United States in 1863 and had an active musical career in Philadelphia, which included an organist position at St. James the Less. At Trinity Church in New York City, he modeled with distinction the British cathedral tradition of music. Messiter was an editor of the Episcopal Hymnal (1893), compiled the Psalter (1889) and Choir Office Book (1891), and wrote a musical history of Trinity Episcopal Church, New York (1906). A short-meter tune, MARION is distinguished by an appealing melodic contour and an effective refrain line. Sing stanzas 1-4 in harmony and the final, doxological stanza in unison. The refrain would benefit from the use of a descant. Do not rush! Though MARION is the preferred tune for congregational singing of this text, choir directors may want to consider using Richard Dirksen's anthem on his VINEYARD HAVEN tune (163) for choral festivals. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "William Knapp (b. Wareham, Dorsetshire, England, 1698; d. Poole, Dorsetshire, 1768) composed WAREHAM, so named for his birthplace. A glover by trade, Knapp served as the parish clerk at St. James's Church in Poole (1729-1768) and was organist in both Wareham and Poole. Known in his time as the \"country psalm-singer,\" Knapp published A Set of New Psalm Tunes and Anthems (1738) and New Church Melody (1753). WAREHAM was published in his 1738 collection with the melody in the tenor as a setting for Psalm 36. Its slightly simplified form appears in nearly all modern hymnals. The tune is easy to sing because of its almost continuous stepwise motion and smooth melodic Contour. Try assigning the stanzas as follows for antiphonal singing: stanzas 1 and 2 to one group, stanzas 3 and 4 to another, and the remaining three stanzas to the entire Congregation. Sing in harmony for the even-numbered stanzas, but the strength of unison singing is necessary for stanza 7. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook",

The setting here is by John B. Dykes ( PHH 147 ), originally composed as a setting for William Whiting's \"Eternal Father, Strong to Save.\" Published in Hymns Ancient and Modern (1861) with that text, MELITA is often referred to as the \"navy hymn.\" The tune is named after the island of Malta where Paul was shipwrecked. A fine tune, MELITA is marked by good use of melodic sequences and a harmony that features several dominant sevenths (both are Dykes's trademarks). Sing in harmony; because the lines flow into each other in almost breathless fashion, use a stately tempo. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1987",

    "notes": "Martin Luther's versification of the Lord's Prayer was set to this tune in Valentin Schumann's hymnal, Geistliche Lieder (1539); the tune, whose composer remains unknown, had some earlier use. The tune name derives from Luther's German incipit: “Vater unser im Himmelreich….” Because VATER UNSER found later use in British and Scottish psalters as a setting for Psalm 112, it acquired the alternate title OLD 112TH in some hymnals. Johann S. Bach ( PHH 7 ) used this tune in his St. John Passion (1724)–from which the Psalter Hymnal gets its harmonization–and in Cantatas 90,101, and 102, among others. Bach also wrote organ preludes on the melody. Felix Mendelssohn arranged a famous organ treatment on this tune in his Sixth Organ Sonata . One of the classic chorales, VATER UNSER features phrases grouped into three long lines. Use solid organ tone and sing in harmony if resources permit. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "Cyril V. Taylor ( PHH 286 ) composed ABBOT'S LEIGH in May of 1941 when he was working for the Religious Broadcasting Department of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). The BBC had received complaints about the use of AUSTRIA (tune for the Austrian national hymn) during this time of war, a tune then set to \"Glorious Things of You Are Spoken\" (506). Thus Taylor originally composed his tune for that text. First printed in a leaflet, ABBOT'S LEIGH was published in Hymns Ancient and Modern Revised (1950), Congregational Praise (1951), and the BBC Hymn Book (1951), of which Taylor was editor. No modern hymnal would want to omit this great twentieth-century tune! ABBOT'S LEIGH is named for a village near Bristol, England, where Taylor composed the tune. (Bristol was wartime headquarters for the BBC). [BBC moved to St. Poul's, Bedford where the tune was composed; Abbot's Leigh was the name of Taylor's parish ( Mick Perrier, Hymnary user )] This dramatic tune with bold melodic gestures and a bar form shape (AAB) is suitable for unison or harmony singing. Use strong accompaniment with a stately tempo. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook",

    "notes": "NYLAND, named for a province in Finland, is a folk melody from Kuortane, South Ostrobothnia, Finland. In fact, the tune is also known as KUORTANE. NYLAND was first published with a hymn text in an appendix to the 1909 edition of the Finnish Suomen Evankelis Luterilaisen Kirken Koraalikirja. It gained popularity in the English-speaking world after David Evans's use of it in the British Church Hymnary of 1927 as a setting for Anna 1. Waring's text \"In Heavenly Love Abiding.\" Evans (b. Resolven, Glamorganshire, Wales, 1874; d. Rosllannerchrugog, Denbighshire, Wales, 1948) edited that hymnal, which was the source of a number of his harmonizations, including this one. David Evans was an important leader in Welsh church music. Educated at Arnold College, Swansea, and at University College, Cardiff, he received a doctorate in music from Oxford University. His longest professional post was as professor of music at University College in Cardiff (1903-1939), where he organized a large music department. He was also a well-known and respected judge at Welsh hymn-singing festivals and a composer of many orchestral and choral works, anthems, service music, and hymn tunes. NYLAND is a modified rounded bar-form tune (AA'BA') with a wide-ranging melodic contour and a fine harmonization for part singing. It needs good singers for the harmony and requires organ phrasing that produces four long lines. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook",

No factual data exists for the legend that this text and tune date back to the twelfth-century crusades, although those apocryphal stories explain one of the names by which this tune is known, namely, CRUSADER'S HYMN. After Franz Liszt used the tune for a crusaders' march in his oratorio The Legend of St. Elizabeth (1862), the tune also became known as ST. ELIZABETH. The tune consists primarily of a few melodic sequences and their variations. It could either be sung gently, perhaps with guitar and flute accompaniment, or it could be sung with great power with almost full organ for stanzas 1 and 4. Try singing in harmony with no accompaniment at all for stanzas 2 and 3. Sing in four long lines rather than eight short phrases. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "The original version of WINCHESTER NEW appeared in Musikalisches Handbuch der geistlichen Melodien, published in Hamburg, Germany, in 1690 by Georg Wittwe. It was set to the text “Wer nur den lieben Gott” (see 446). An expanded version of the tune was a setting for \"Dir, dir Jehova\" (see 203) in Johann Freylinghausen's Geistreiches Gesangbuch (1704). The melody was also used by John and Charles Wesley ( PHH 267 ) for their texts and was reworked by William J. Havergal as a long-meter tune in his Old Church Psalmody (1864). Havergal's version closely resembled its original 1690 form. Named for the ancient English city in Hampshire noted for its cathedral, the tune gained much popularity because of its extended use. It is called WINCHESTER NEW (also called CRASSELIUS) to distinguish it from WINCHESTER OLD (see 215 and 628). Sing this dignified psalm tune in unison on the outer stanzas and in parts on the middle ones. Use solid organ tone and phrase in two long lines. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "William Boyd (b. Montego Bay, Jamaica, 1847; d. Paddington, England, 1928) composed PENTECOST in 1864 for the hymn text \"Come, Holy Ghost, Our Souls Inspire\"; it was published in 1868 in Thirty-Two Hymn Tunes Composed by Members of the University of Oxford . The name PENTECOST derives from the subject matter of that hymn text. Boyd was educated at Hurstpierpoint, where the hymn writer Sabine Baring-Gould ( PHH 522 ) was one of his teachers, and at Worcester College, Oxford. He was ordained in the Church of England and served the Church of All Saints, Norfolk Square, London, from 1893-1918. The tune PENTECOST was retained from the 1959 Psalter Hymnal, though Dewey Westra originally versified Mary's song for the tune DUKE STREET (412). The humble, meditative character of PENTECOST stands in contrast to the spirit of rejoicing found in DUKE STREET and the settings at 478 and 622. The text can also be sung to PUER NOBIS (327). A simple chant-like tune with a range of only five tones in the melody, PENTECOST is one of the \"generic\" Victorian tunes of its time (see also QUEBEC, 141, 307; ST. CRISPIN, 276; MORECAMBE 419; and MARYTON, 573). Sing it in harmony, perhaps unaccompanied, but with a firm pulse and not too slowly. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "Henry Stephen Cutler (b. Boston, MA, 1824; d. Boston, 1902) composed ALL SAINTS NEW in 1872 for Reginald Heber's ( PHH 249 ) text \"The Son of God Goes Forth to War,\" and the two were published together in Hymnal with Tunes, Old and New (1872). That text refers to \"the glorious band\" of God's people, helping to explain the chosen tune title. The NEW is to distinguish this tune from others that are also called ALL SAINTS. ALL SAINTS NEW has a processional or martial character, inherited no doubt from Cutler's love for the British cathedral tradition of choir processions. Sing the tune in parts at a moderate tempo. Cutler studied music in Frankfurt, Germany, in 1844. He moved to England, where he listened with interest to the cathedral choirs and came under the influence of the Oxford Movement. Returning to Boston in 1846, Cutler became organist of the Episcopal Church of the Advent and formed a choir of men and boys, to whom he introduced the wearing of liturgical robes. When he took a position at Trinity Church in New York City, he removed women from the choir and used the occasion of a visit by the Prince of Wales to the church to introduce his newly vested men and boys' choir. He also moved the choir from the gallery to the chancel and initiated the chanting of the psalms and the singing of part of the worship service. Cutler compiled The Psalter, with Chants (1858) and published The Trinity Psalter (1864) and Trinity Anthems (1865). -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "Composed by John Darwall (b. Haughton, Staffordshire, England, 1731; d. Walsall, Staffordshire, England, 1789), DARWALL'S 148TH was first published as a setting for Psalm 148 in Aaron William's New Universal Psalmodist (1770) with only soprano and bass parts. The harmonization dates from the nineteenth century. The son of a pastor, Darwall attended Manchester Grammar School and Brasenose College, Oxford, England (1752-1756). He became the curate and later the vicar of St. Matthew's Parish Church in Walsall, where he remained until his death. Darwall was a poet and amateur musician. He composed a soprano tune and bass line for each of the 150 psalm versifications in the Tate and Brady New Version of the Psalms of David (l696). In an organ dedication speech in 1773 Darwall advocated singing the \"Psalm tunes in quicker time than common [in order that] six verses might be sung in the same space of time that four generally are.\" The only Darwall tune still in common use, DARWALL'S 148TH is marked by both its dramatic opening figure (outlining the tonic chord) and by the convincing ascent of, the final line. Sing in unison or in parts at a lively tempo. Try adding trumpets both to the melody as well as to the descant by Sydney H. Nicholson ( PHH 358 ) on stanza 4. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

Along with his original harmonizations, intended to interpret the different stanzas, the tune was also included in the appendix to Robert Brown¬ Borthwick's Supplemental Hymn and Tune Book (1869). LAUDA ANIMA is one of the finest tunes that arose out of the Victorian era. A reviewer in The Musical Times, June 1869, said, \"It is at once the most beautiful and dignified hymn tune which has lately come under our notice.\" Try singing in concertato fashion: the unison stanzas sung by the congregation and stanza 2 as well as the original stanza 4 (see below) sung by the choir in harmony, preferably unaccompanied. Frail as summer's flower we flourish, blows the wind and it is gone; but while mortals rise and perish, God endures unchanging on. Alleluia, alleluia, praise the High Eternal One. -based on Psalm 103:15-17 Singers and accompanists will want to emphasize the melodic contours and not the marching rhythms emphasized by the bar lines. Organists, take advantage of Goss's interpretation of the various stanzas by playing the first stanza with solid and firm foundation stops, the second (if accompanied) with quieter sound, and the third with a very legato gentle sound on strings. Then open all the stops for a majestic conclusion on the fourth stanza. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook",

    "notes": "REDHEAD 76 is named for its composer, who published it as number 76 in his influential Church Hymn Tunes, Ancient and Modern (1853) as a setting for the hymn text \"Rock of Ages.\" It has been associated with Psalm 51 since the 1912 Psalter , where the tune was named AJALON. The tune is also known as PETRA from its association with \"Rock of Ages,\" and GETHSEMANE, which derives from the text \"Go to Dark Gethsemane\" (381). Of the three long lines constituting REDHEAD 76, the last is almost identical to the first, and the middle line has an internal repeat. Well-suited to singing in parts, this music is also appropriate for unaccompanied singing. Richard Redhead (b. Harrow, Middlesex, England, 1820; d. Hellingley, Sussex, England, 1901) was a chorister at Magdalen College, Oxford. At age nineteen he was invited to become organist at Margaret Chapel (later All Saints Church), London. Greatly influencing the musical tradition of the church, he remained in that position for twenty-five years as organist and an excellent trainer of the boys' choirs. Redhead and the church's rector, Frederick Oakeley ( PHH 340 ), were strongly committed to the Oxford Movement, which favored the introduction of Roman elements into Anglican worship. Together they produced the first Anglican plainsong psalter, Laudes Diurnae (1843). Redhead spent the latter part of his career as organist at St. Mary Magdalene Church in Paddington (1864-1894). -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook",

    "notes": "C. Hubert H. Parry's ( PHH 145 ) RUSTINGTON was first published in the Westminster Abbey Hymn Book (1897) as a setting for Benjamin Webb's \"Praise the Rock of Our Salvation.\" The tune is named for the village in Sussex, England, where Parry lived for some years and where he died. This is such a distinguished melody that it is probably best to sing all the stanzas in unison, although confident choirs will want to sing the harmony of the middle stanzas. Organists, use bright mixtures. The tune AUSTRIA is most commonly associated with this text, as it was in earlier editions of the Psalter Hymnal . In 1985, however, the synod of the Christian Reformed Church rejected the use of AUSTRIA in its hymnal because Dutch immigrants and Jewish Christians associate that tune with its use by Nazis during World War II. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "GENEVAN 98/118 is the one tune in the Psalter Hymnal used for two psalms. It was first published in the 1551 Genevan Psalter as a setting for Psalm 118; in the 1562 edition it was also set to Psalm 98 (hence both numbers in the tune name). The tune is also often named RENDEZ A DIEV, the French incipit for Psalm 118. This beloved tune is one of the finest and most widely sung of the Genevan psalm tunes (next to GENEVAN 134). Its clear melodic structure and vibrant rhythm call for firm accompaniment with bright organ registration, though some congregations may want to try unaccompanied singing on a stanza or two in the tradition of the sixteenth-century Reformers. Many modern hymnals set this tune to versifications of Psalm 98 or to hymn texts such as the one at 314. The 1564 harmonization here by Claude Goudimel ( PHH 6 ) originally placed the melody in the tenor. See 98 and 314 for other harmonizations of this tune; 314 is placed in the key of F. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

WER NUR DEN LIEBEN GOTT is a bar form (AAB) with rhythmic interest and mainly stepwise melodic lines. Sing in a steady unison on stanzas 1 and 3 and in harmony on stanza 2 with a quieter organ registration. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook",

    "notes": "IN BABILONE is a traditional Dutch melody that appeared in Oude en Nieuwe Hollantse Boerenlities en Contradansen (Old and New Dutch Peasant Songs and Country Dances) , c. 1710. Ralph Vaughan Williams ( PHH 316 ) discovered this tune as arranged by Julius Rontgen (b. Leipzig, Germany, 1855; d. Utrecht, the Netherlands, 1932) and included it in The English Hymnal (1906), from which it gained widespread use. A rounded barform tune (AABA), IN BABILONE provides a fine setting for Psalm 117's cosmic scope. Because this song has only one stanza, use the tune as an alternate to other texts in 87 87 D so that congregations may sing it more often. Stretch the cadence a bit to catch a breath at the end of line 3 (ending in the word accord ). An important Dutch pianist, composer, conductor, scholar, and editor, Rontgen studied music in Leipzig with well-known German teachers. In 1877 he moved to Amsterdam, where he first taught at the Amsterdam Conservatory. In 1886 he became conductor of the Society for the Advancement of Musical Art. He returned to the Conservatory as director in 1918, and then retired in 1924 to devote himself to composition. He was a friend of leading composers of his day, including Liszt, Brahms, and Grieg, and wrote a biography of Grieg. Rontgen's compositions include symphonies, chamber works, operas, and film scores. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

W.H. Havergal, the melody being unaltered. EVAN II is the entire melody of the same song, harmonized by the author as a C.M.D. about the year 1867. The following note, written upon a copy of EVAN, given as autograph at the request of a friend, supplies his own account of its origin: \"EVAN, framed by Dr. Lowell Mason of New York, from a sacred song, 'O thou dread Power,' by W.H. Havergal, M.A., original air first published in 1847. The beautiful words of the sacred song were written by Burns for the family of Dr. Lawrie. The music to them is in triple time, and in the key of A-flat. The tune EVAN comprises only part of the original melody. As the American arrangement was a sad estrangement, I have reconstructed the tune after a more correct form. Why it was called EVAN I know not. Still I do not approve the tune. Leamington, March 19th, 1870. W.H. Havergal.\" — Havergal’s Psalmody and Century of Chants (London: R. Cocks, 1871), p. xix.",

'Wilt heden nu treden,\" which celebrated Dutch freedom from Spanish rule, was always popular in the Netherlands, but gained international popularity through an arrangement by Eduard Kremser in his Sechs Altniederlandische Volkslieder (1877) for men's voices. This collection of six songs in German translation from Valerius's anthology was the source of the older English text, 'We Gather Together.\" Keep a firm but stately tempo with strong, solid organ registration. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1998",

    "notes": "HENDON was composed by Henri A. Cesar Malan (b. Geneva, Switzerland, 1787; d. Vandoeuvres, Switzerland, 1864) and included in a series of his own hymn texts and tunes that he began to publish in France in 1823, and which ultimately became his great hymnal Chants de Sion (1841). HENDON is thought to date from 1827. Lowell Mason ( PHH 96 ) brought the tune to North America and published it in his Carmina Sacra (1841); that version is the one published in the Psalter Hymnal. Hendon is a village in Middlesex, England. Because HENDON has five phrases, the text has to repeat its fourth line in each stanza to fit the music. Try singing in two units, grouping the first two phrases together and then the last three. Articulate the repeated tones clearly on the organ. Malan's harmonization is a good one for part singing by the entire congregation. Antiphonal performance may be best when singing the entire six stanzas; stanza 3 is a perfect candidate for unaccompanied singing. Educated at the College of Geneva, Malan intended to become a businessman but instead was led to a ministerial career. In 1810 he was ordained in the National Reformed Church of Switzerland. A popular preacher at the Chapelle du Temoignage in Geneva, he attacked the formalism and liberalism of the national church and urged both a return to strict Calvinism and the need for conversion. When the church forbade him access to its pulpits, Malan had a church built in his garden and continued to preach to a large congregation. In his later years he devoted much of his energy to revival preaching. He traveled in Switzerland, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, England, and Scotland, where he conducted six revival tours and preached to a large following. A writer of several books and countless tracts, many of them translated into English, Malan also wrote the texts and tunes of over a thousand hymns, many of which became popular in the French Protestant churches. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook",

    "notes": "SCHUMANN is one of many hymn tunes arranged by Lowell Mason ( PHH 96 ). He first published the arrangement in Cantica Laudis (1850), a collection he edited with George J. Webb ( PHH 559 ). First called WHITE, the tune was marked \"Arr. from Schumann\" and was thus ascribed to the German composer Robert A. Schumann. Although Clara Schumann doubted that it came from her husband's music, the tune's name derives from that early association with Schumann's name. SCHUMANN builds to an effective climax in its final line–the first line is unfortunately broken into two short phrases, but sensitive organists and singers will try to tie these into one long line. Try antiphonal singing or a combination of unison and harmony stanzas when singing the entire hymn. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

Variants of the tune abound; the version found in the Psalter Hymnal came from Johann Schicht's Allgemeines Choralbuch (1819), and the harmonization came from Conrad Kocher's ( PHH 358 ) setting in his Zions Harfe (1855). William H. Monk's ( PHH 332 ) shortened version of this tune (HURSLEY) is often associated with John Keble's evening hymn \"Sun of My Soul.\" A sturdy melody, GROSSER GOTT is in simple bar form (AAB). Sing in parts on stanzas 1-3 and add the descant by Emily R. Brink ( PHH 158 ) to unison singing on stanza 4. Use full organ tone with some festive mixtures. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1987",

The tune is arbitrarily named after a water-cure spa in Silesia, Austria, which became famous in the 1820s. The rhythmic structure of Crüger's tune has been altered in most hymnals by the adoption of \"gathering\" notes (longer beginning notes to every phrase) in the style of British psalm tunes. Originally the second and fourth phrases began with a quarter rest and quarter note. Sing in harmony or in unison with light accompaniment suited to this prayer hymn. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook",

Those characteristics help to support the humanness of this text: We are to be the children (folk) of God! Sing in unison or in harmony, but given the tune's many eighth notes, do not rush. Congregations used to certain rhythmic patterns in hymn tunes will be challenged by the new rhythms at the transition from line 3 to line 4; accompanists should give leadership there. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

BUNESSAN is also well known as the setting for Eleanor Farjeon's \"Morning Has Broken\" (1931), published in many hymnals and widely popularized by Cat Stevens, who recorded an arrangement of the tune in 1971. BUNESSAN is intended for unison singing; use a light accompaniment on the organ (or organ trio style) or folk instruments. Dale Grotenhuis ( PHH 4 ) harmonized the tune for the Psalter Hymnal in 1985. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

In 1816 it was credited to \"Mr. Dean,\" which some scholars believe was a misprinted reference to Elkanah K. Dare, a composer who contributed more than a dozen tunes to Wyeth's Repository. In the original harmonization the melody was in the tenor. The tune is also known as CONSOLATION (and KENTUCKY HARMONY), its title in Ananias Davisson's Kentucky Harmony (1816), where it was set to Isaac Watts' morning song, \"Once More, My Soul, the Rising Day.\" Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988 ————— Note: In its earliest source, Sixteen Tune Settings (1812), it was credited to Lucius Chapin.",

Its lines consist of short figures and phrases bound together by the consistent rhythmic pattern of the Polish mazurka (made famous by Frederic Chopin). Note especially the third line with its fine sequences and harmonic suspensions. Sing in parts with adults or in unison with young children. Use light organ accompaniment, preferably played on two manuals and pedal. Add handbells (or even sleigh bells) on the first beat of each bar. Sing in four long lines and avoid the choppiness suggested by the short melodic phrases. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "Although he composed nearly one hundred works, Franz Gruber is remembered for only one–the tune of \"Silent Night,\" composed on Christmas Eve, 1818. He scored the tune for tenor and bass soli (sung by Mohr and Gruber on that night) with the final phrase to be repeated in harmony (sung by the village choir girls); the singing was accompanied by guitar. In 1854 he wrote an account of the history of \"Stille Nacht, heilige Nacht,\" accompanied by a score (dated 1833) for two solo voices, chorus, organ, pizzicato strings, and two horns. Gruber was born into a linen weaver's family and studied violin and organ even though his father wanted him to work in the family business. In addition to serving as parish organist for St. Nicholas Church in Obendorf, he taught school in nearby Arnsdorf (1807-1829) and Berndorf (1829-1833). He spent the balance of his career as organist and choir director in Hallein, where he founded the famous Hallein Choral Society. STILLE NACHT is a pastoral tune in the style of a landler or Austrian siciliano (slow waltz). The tune is intended for gentle singing with light accompaniment (recall its historic performance on guitar). The Psalter Hymnal harmonization is mainly the work of Carl Reinecke (1910). Sing in four parts, perhaps unaccompanied. Or you may want to try only two-part singing (soprano and alto) for some stanzas. Try using a flute or recorder descant; there are many published settings for these instruments. In smaller worship settings try guitar and flute or recorder. Or have children sing some stanzas in alternation with the Congregation. Sing in two pulses per bar. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1987",

    "notes": "Henry Kemble Oliver (b. Beverly, MA, 1800; d. Salem, MA, 1885) composed FEDERAL STREET in 1832, possibly as an imitation of earlier psalm tunes in long meter. He took it to a music class taught by Lowell Mason (who may have contributed to the harmony); Mason ( PHH 96 ) published it in his Boston Academy Collection of Church Music (1836).The tune name refers to the street in Boston where Oliver's boyhood church stood, al1 to the street in Salem where Oliver's wife, Sally, was “reared, wooed, won, and married.” Kemble was educated at Harvard and Dartmouth. He taught in the public schools of Salem (1818-1842) and was superintendent of the Atlantic Cotton Mills in Lawrence, Massachusetts (1848-1858). His civic service included being mayor of Lawrence (1859¬1861) and Salem (1877-1880), state treasurer (1861-1865), and organizer of the Massachusetts Bureau of Statistics and Labor (1867-1873). Oliver was organist at several churches, including Park Street Congregational Church in Boston, North Church in Salem, and the Unitarian Church in Lawrence. A founder of the Mozart Association and several choral societies in Salem, he published his hymn tunes in Hymn and Psalm Tunes (1860) and Original Hymn Tunes (1875). While the text in this song often consists of two long lines, this tune unfortunately insists on four phrases. Trained choirs can easily couple the short phrases into the longer units the text calls for, but congregations may need persistent help from the organist or choir to complete the longer lines. Sing this tune in harmony. Try the alternate tune MELCOMBE (274) for a closer match of textual lines to musical phrases. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook",

    "notes": "Adapting a tune written for Psalm 100 found in Wolff Köphel's Psalter (1538), Nicolai composed WIE SCHÖN LEUCHTET, which was published with the text in 1599. Although the tune was originally more varied rhythmically, the hymnal version here is isorhythmic (all equal rhythms) and set to the rich harmonization of Johann S. Bach ( PHH 7 ). That setting will delight all choristers and challenge the organist's feet! Bach also used this tune in his cantatas 1, 36, 37, 61, and 172 and wrote a chorale prelude based on it (as have many other–especially Lutheran–composers). A rounded bar form (AABA) tune, WIE SCHÖN LEUCHTET is a noble melody that has lost some of its strength due to isorhythm but has regained new color and vigor through the Bach harmonization. Try having the congregation sing this hymn in unison with harmony sung by the choir or played by brass instruments. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook",

    "notes": "ST. DENIO is based on \"Can mlynedd i nawr\" (\"A Hundred Years from Now\"), a traditional Welsh ballad popular in the early nineteenth century. It was first published as a hymn tune in John Roberts's Caniadau y Cyssegr ( Hymns of the Sanctuary, 1839). The tune title refers to St. Denis, the patron saint of France. ST. DENIO is a sturdy tune in rounded bar form (AABA'); its bright character in a major key should put to rest the notion that all Welsh tunes are sad and in minor key. It bears vigorous performance with singing in harmony supported by solid organ tone. The final stanza is a jubilant profession of how God blesses–save the extra reeds and mixtures for it! John Roberts (b. Tanrhiwfelen, Penllwyn, near Aberystwyth, Wales, 1822; d. Vron, Caernarvon, Wales, 1877) is also known by his Welsh name, Ieuan Gwyllt (Wild John) to distinguish him from many other John Roberts. He began conducting choirs at the age of fourteen and was a schoolteacher at sixteen. Ordained in the (Calvinist) Methodist ministry in 1859, he served congregations in Aberdare and Llanberis. In 1859 he also founded the Welsh singing festival \"Gymanfa ganu\" and compiled the important Calvinist Methodist hymnal Llyfr Tonau CynulleidfaolPHH 73) hymnal, Swn y Iiwvili (1874). -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "The original form of ST. EDITH (also known as ST. HILDA) was composed in 1793 by Justin Heinrich Knecht for the text “Der neidern Menschhiet Hülle.” It was published in Vollstandige Sammlung … Choralmelodien (1799), edited by Johann Friedrich Christmann and Knecht, who composed ninety-seven of the tunes in the collection. Knecht (b. Biberach, Germany, 1752; d. Biberach, 1817) mastered the flute, oboe, trumpet, violin, and organ. He taught literature in Biberach and became the town’s music director in 1792, pioneering the use of program notes in his public concerts. After serving as director of the theater orchestra in Stuttgard (1807-1809), he returned to Biberach for the rest of his life. Knecht was a prolific composer of songs for the stage, church music for the organ and choir, and instrumental pieces. He also wrote several theoretical works on music and method books for organ playing. Edward Husband (b. Hampshire, England, 1843; d. Folkestone, Kent, England 1908) exchanged two lines of the original tune with two lines of his own in 1871 to produce the current setting. Educated at St. Aidan’s College, Birkenhead, Husband was ordained in the Church of England in 1867. He was a pastor in Atherton from 1866 to 1872, after which he served at St. Michael and All Angels’ Church in Folkestone. In 1885 he compiled an Appendix of hymn tunes for the Folkestone church. An organ teacher as well as a pastor, Husband edited The Mission Hymnal (1874) and Supplemental Tunes to Popular Hymns (1882). The tune title refers to the tenth-century British virgin Edith of Wilton (near Salisbury, Wiltshire), who refused various important positions and instead served the poor. Sing this tune in four broad phrases with rhythmic precision. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook",

London, 1909) and first published by Novello in a pamplet in 1861 as a setting for the hymn text \"Abide with Me.\" Several other texts have also been set to the tune, which is one of Langran's best. Sing it in parts, perhaps unaccompanied on one or more stanzas. Langran studied organ as a youth but did not receive his Bachelor of Music degree from Oxford until he was forty-nine years old. He had several organist positions–the longest was at St. Paul's Church, Tottenham, England, from 1870 to 1909. He also taught music at St. Katherine's Training College for Schoolmistresses (1878-1909). Music editor of the New Mitre Hymnal (1875), Langran composed around fifty hymn tunes and contributed several of them to early editions of Hymns Ancient and Modern. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "ST. MICHAEL'S is an anonymous tune first published by William Gawler (b. Lambeth, London, England, 1750; d. London, 1809) in 1789 in his London collection Hymns and Psalms Used at the Asylum for Female Orphans (1785-1789). Gawler was organist at the Asylum of Refuge for French Orphans in Lambeth, the first such residence in England for homeless girls. He published a variety of voluntaries for organ. In some hymnals the tune has been attributed to Mozart or Haydn. ST. MICHAEL'S (which refers to the archangel Michael in the Bible) is also known as ST. MICHEL'S, MOZART, or GOSHEN. Some hymnals set this text to ST. MATTHEW, a useful alternate tune (see 21). The tune is a rounded bar form (AABA), which displays the symmetry of phrases and the cadences often associated with the classical style. Sing in harmony. Perhaps a choir could sing stanzas 1 and 2a, which tell the story, with the congregation joining in with the prayer in stanzas 2b and 3. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "Traditionally used for Montgomery's text and for Peter Abelard's \"Alone Thou Goest Forth, O Lord,\" BANGOR comes from William Tans'ur's A Compleat Melody: or the Harmony of Syon (the preface of which is dated 1734). In that collection the tune was a three-part setting for Psalm 12 (and for Psalm 11 in a 1738 reprint). Possibly alluding to an earlier origin, the tune title recalls the Welsh borough and city Bangor. The tune was popular in Scotland: Robert Burns refers to it in his poem 'The Ordination\": \"an' skirl up the Bangor.\" BANGOR is a solemn but expressive tune, though not mournful. It is sturdy and supportive of the classic anamnesis interpretation of Montgomery's text. Sing in harmony on stanzas 1 through 4, and sing in unison on stanza 5–or try singing the first three phrases in harmony and the fourth in unison to highlight the important concluding phrase in each stanza. Tans'ur (originally Tanzer; b. Dunchurch, Warwickshire, England, 1706; d. St. Neots, Huntingdonshire, England, 1783) was an itinerant music teacher and song leader who served as occasional organist in churches in Barnes, Ewell, Cambridge, Stamford, and Boston (England). Later he lived in St. Neots, where he was a bookseller and music teacher. He published numerous pedagogical works on music as well as psalm books, including A Compleat Melody: or Harmony of Syon (1734), The Psalm Singer's Jewel (1760), and Melodia Sacra (1771); many of his books were reprinted numerous times. It is not always clear which tunes in these collections Tans'ur composed himself or which he adapted from other sources. A selection from his tunebooks was published in the United States as The American Harmony (1771), a book that influenced William Billings in his composing of psalm tunes. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

ETHELDREDA in 1860; it was published in James Turle's Psalms and Hymns for Public Worship (1863). Educated at Catharine Hall, Cambridge, England, Turton became a professor of mathematics at Cambridge in 1822 and five years later a professor of divinity at the same school. In 1830 he left Cambridge to become Dean of Peter borough. He also served as Dean of Westminster (1842-1845) and as Bishop of Ely from 1845 until his death. Turton wrote many polemical tracts and composed some church music. This simple but charming tune is in the style of the older English psalm tunes. Sing much of the hymn in harmony, possibly with some antiphonal stanzas, but sing stanza 7 in unison. The singing and its accompaniment should contribute to the sense of awe inherent in the text. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook",

    "notes": "The tune was named after its composer and published in the British volume The Hymnary (1872). TOURS has four broad phrases. Its repetitions of melodic and rhythmic units make it accessible and loved. The harmony suggests a stately tempo. Berthold Tours (b. Rotterdam, the Netherlands, 1838; d. Fulham. London, England, 1897) received an early musical education from his father, a well-known Dutch organist of the St. Laurents Kerk, Rotterdam, and continued his training in conservatories in Leipzig and Brussels. He also spent two years studying in Russia. Given the opportunity to teach violin in London and to play in several orchestras, he moved to London in 1861 and settled there permanently. In 1862 Tours became organist of the Swiss Church (Holborne) in London. From 1878 on he served as an editor and arranger for Novello, the well-known music publisher. Tours wrote piano arrangements of operas and oratorios but is best remembered for his hymn tunes, anthems, and liturgical service music. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "MANOAH was first published in Henry W. Greatorex's Collection of Psalm and Hymn Tunes (1851). This anthology (later editions had alternate titles) contained one of the best tune collections of its era and included thirty-seven original compositions and arrangements by compiler Greatorex as well as melodies by his father, Thomas, and grandfather Anthony. Because no other source has been traced, it is believed that Greatorex composed MANOAH. Greatorex (b. Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England, 1813; d. Charleston, SC, 1858) received his early music training from his father, who was organist at Westminster Abbey. After moving to the United States in 1839, he served as organist at the Center Congregational Church and at St. John's Church, both in Hartford, Connecticut. He accepted the position of organist at St. Paul's Episcopal Church around 1846 and later became organist and choirmaster of the Calvary Episcopal Church, both in New York City. His final musical position was at the Episcopal Church in Charleston. The composer gave arbitrary names to his tunes: Manoah was the father of Samson in the Old Testament. This well-crafted common-meter tune features some repetition of melodic motives and a harmonization that invites part singing. Sing in harmony in two long lines rather than four short phrases. Use moderate organ accompaniment at first, but make sure it swells for stanza 4. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "Composed by Alexander R. Reinagle (b. Brighton, Sussex, England, 1799; d. Kidlington, Oxfordshire, England, 1877), ST. PETER was published as a setting for Psalm 118 in Reinagle's Psalm Tunes for the Voice and Pianoforte (c. 1836). The tune first appeared with Newton's text in Hymns Ancient and Modern (1861); it is now usually associated with this text, for which it is a better match than for Psalm 118. The tune was named after St. Peter-in-the-East, the church in Oxford, England, where Reinagle was organist from 1822-1853. Little is known of Reinagle's early life. Of Austrian descent, he came from a family of musicians and became a well-known organ teacher. A writer of teaching manuals for string instruments, Reinagle also compiled two books of hymn tunes, the 1836 collection and A Collection of Psalm and Hymn Tunes (1840). He also composed a piano sonata and some church music. ST. PETER features descending motion after an initial rise. Sing stanzas 1-2 and 4-5 in parts, but sing the crucial middle stanza in unison. This music needs to express the fervor of the text without any festive fanfares. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "ST. MAGNUS first appeared in Henry Playford's Divine Companion (1707 ed.) as an anonymous tune with soprano and bass parts. The tune was later credited to Jeremiah Clark (b. London, England, c. 1670; d. London, 1707), who was a chorister in the Chapel Royal and sang at the coronation of James II in 1685. Later he served as organist in Winchester College, St. Paul's Cathedral, and the Chapel Royal. He shot himself to death in a fit of depression, apparently because of an unhappy romance. Supported by Queen Anne, Clark was a prominent composer in his day, writing songs for the stage as well as anthems, psalm tunes, and harpsichord works. One well-known piece, the Trumpet Voluntary , was long attributed to his contemporary Henry Purcell ( PHH 612 ) but is now recognized as Clark's composition. Robert Bridges ( PHH 386 ) and Ralph Vaughan Williams ( PHH 316 ) reintroduced Clark's hymn tunes for congregational use in the twentieth century in the Yattendon Hymnal (1899) and The English Hymnal (1906). Although ST. MAGNUS was originally used as a setting for Psalm 117, it has been associated with this text since they were combined in the 1868 Appendix to Hymns Ancient and Modern . The tune is named for the Church of St. Magnus the Martyr, built by Christopher Wren in 1676 on Lower Thames Street near the old London Bridge, England. ST. MAGNUS consists of two long lines, each of which has its own sense of climax. The octave leap in the final phrase has a stunning effect, like a vault in a Gothic cathedral. Assign stanzas for antiphonal singing in unison and/ or in harmony. Organ accompaniment should be lively, with full, bright registration. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "RICHMOND (also known as CHESTERFIELD) is a florid tune originally written by Thomas Haweis ( PHH 270 ) and published in his collection Carmina Christo (1792). Samuel Webbe, Jr., adapted and shortened the tune and published it in his Collection of Psalm Tunes (1808). It was reprinted in 1853 in Webbe's Psalmody. Webbe named the tune after Rev. Leigh Richmond, a friend of Haweis's. The CHESTERFIELD name comes from Lord Chesterfield, a statesman who frequently visited Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon, for whom Haweis worked as a chaplain. At its opening the tune has a \"rocket\" motif radiating a sense of confidence. With its various revisions the melody has lost its original florid character, but the harmonization (from Hymns Ancient and Modern Revised , 1950) provides strength and vigor, and the descant by Craig S. Lang ( PHH 253 ) introduces another florid line for festive singing of stanza 4. Sing stanza 1 in unison and stanzas 2 and 3 with jubilant accompaniment. Because stanza 4 is the only one directed to Christ, it should receive a different musical treat¬ment than the other stanzas. Strong unison singing, a full accompaniment, and the use of the vocal or instrumental descant will help the \"glad hosannas. . . ring.\" Like his father Samuel, Sr. ( PHH 112 ), Samuel Webbe, Jr. (b. London, 1770; d. London, 1843), was very active in both sacred and secular music. Together they published A Collection of Motets and Antiphons (1792). He was active as organist in Liverpool and London at both Unitarian and Roman Catholic churches. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "The tune NOEL (also used at 185) is also known as EARDISLEY or GERARD. Arthur Seymour Sullivan (b Lambeth, London. England. 1842; d. Westminster, London, 1900) adapted this traditional English melody (probably one of the variants of the folk song \"Dives and Lazarus\"), added phrases of his own to recast the melody in common meter double, and published it first in his Church Hymns with Tunes (1874). In that collection Sullivan set this tune to the Christmas carol \"It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,\" which explains one of the tune names. Though NOEL has frequent changes of harmony, do not sing it too slowly; keep the rhythmic energy moving. Antiphonal performance may highlight the refrain (second half of st. 3 and 5) in this psalm: all sing stanzas 1, 3, and 5; alternate groups sing stanzas 2 and 4. The folk origin of the tune suggests unison singing to most, but Sullivan's harmony will attract some choristers. Either way, this is lively music. Sullivan was born of an Italian mother and an Irish father who was an army bandmaster and a professor of music. Sullivan entered the Chapel Royal as a chorister in 1854. He was elected as the first Mendelssohn scholar in 1856, when he began his studies at the Royal Academy of Music in London. He also studied at the Leipzig Conservatory (1858–1861) and in 1866 was appointed professor of composition at the Royal Academy of Music. Early in his career Sullivan composed oratorios and music for some Shakespeare plays. However, he is best known for writing the music for lyrics by William S. Gilbert, which produced popular operettas such as H.M.S. Pinafore (1878), The Pirates of Penzance (1879), The Mikado (1884), and Yeomen of the Guard (1888). These operettas satirized the court and everyday life in Victorian times. Although he composed some anthems, in the area of church music Sullivan is best remembered for his hymn tunes, written between 1867 and 1874 and published in The Hymnary (1872) and Church Hymn s (1874), both of which he edited. He contributed hymns to A Hymnal Chiefly from The Book of Praise (1867) and to the Presbyterian collection Psalms and Hymns for Divine Worship (1867). A complete collection of his hymns and arrangements was published posthumously as Hymn Tunes by Arthur Sullivan (1902). Sullivan steadfastly refused to grant permission to those who wished to make hymn tunes from the popular melodies in his operettas. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

Bach ( PHH 7 ) used this tune in his Cantata 180; he and many other composers have written organ preludes on the melody     , Like many chorale tunes, SCHMUCKE DICH is in bar form (AABC); it has a melodic; repeat and a delightful, though challenging, change of rhythm in its third line. This music serves well for unison or part singing; a good pace and light accompaniment help to create the joyful intimacy and wonder expressed by the text. \"Leave the gloom haunts of sadness\"; in other words, avoid the funereal tone that sometimes characterizes Reformed observances of the Lord's Supper–this is dance music for a feast! -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "WARRINGTON was composed by Ralph Harrison (b. Chinley, Derbyshire, England, 1748; d. Manchester, Lancashire, England, 1810) and published in his collection of psalm tunes, Sacred Harmony (1784). The tune's rising inflections help to accent words such as erotic (probably the only time this word has been used in a hymn!). Harrison was educated at Warrington Academy (hence the tune title), a school associated with the Unitarian Church. He became an independent minister, spending most of his life serving the Cross Street Chapel in Manchester. He also taught classics at the Manchester Academy, a school he established, and published two volumes of church music entitled Sacred Harmony (1784, 1791), which include a number of his own psalm and hymn tunes. Here are two suggestions for use of this hymn at a wedding: (a) bride and groom (or their representatives) sing a duet, alternating on stanzas 2 and 3; (b) bride and groom sing stanzas 2 and 3 in unison, and the congregation sings stanzas 1 and 4–possibly with this change in line 1 of stanza 4: “With all who hear this solemn vow. . . .” Better known tunes for this text are WINCHESTER NEW (593) and OLD HUNDREDTH (134 and 638). -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook",

McIntosh.\" (p.239), However, the tune, Yarbrough, is very similar to \"Beautiful Zion built above\" which was published in Bradbury's Oriola in 1860, so it is likely this is the tune McIntosh adapted for a 7.7.7.7 meter (Rock of ages,cleft for me)",

It was later published in Joachim Oudaen's David' s Psalmen (1685) as a setting for \"Hoe groot de vruchten zijn.\" The tune is distinguished by the melismas that mark the end of stanza lines and by the rising sequences in the refrain, which provide a fitting word painting for \"arisen.\" Although the melody has a wide range, it has become a popular Easter carol in modern hymnals. The harmonization by Dale Grotenhuis ( PHH 4 ) makes for glorious part singing (many hymnals use a harmonization by Charles Wood). Use medium organ accompaniment, possibly with a trumpet stop or real trumpets. Frans van Liere Psalter Hymnal Handbook",

    "notes": "ARFON is originally a six-phrase Welsh folk tune in minor tonality entitled 'Tros y Garreg.\" Named for a district on the mainland of northern Wales opposite Mon and Anglesey, the tune was published in Edward Jones's Relicks of the Welsh Bards (1784). In the later nineteenth century ARFON was associated in France with the Christmas texts \"Un nouveaux present des cieux\" and 'Joseph est bien marie.\" The tune is a rounded bar form (AABA), set here in major tonality. The harmonization, prepared by Stanley L. Osborne (b. Clarke Township, ON, Canada, 1907) in 1970 was published in the Hymn Book (1971), which was published by two Canadian denominations, the Anglican Church and the United Church. Osborne intended his harmonization first of all for a recorder ensemble and only secondarily for organ or voices. Use a clean, light accompaniment for stanzas 1 and 2 and a broader treatment for stanzas 3 and 4. Sing the middle stanzas in parts. Use trumpet accompaniment for stanza 4. Osborne's interest in both pastoral work and church music is reflected in his education and career. Educated in music at Victoria University, Toronto, and in theology at Emmanuel College, Toronto, he received a Mus.D. from the University of Toronto in 1945 and a Th.D. from Victoria University in 1954. He was ordained in the United Church of Canada in 1932 and served five pastorates. In 1948 he became principal of the Ontario Ladies College (now Trafalgar Castle School), Whitby, Ontario, and in 1968, the full-time secretary of the committee that prepared the Hymn Book (1971). Osborne also published a handbook to that hymnal, If Such Holy Song (1976), which is characterized not only by solid scholarship but also by the expression of strong personal opinions. In 1986 he was appointed a Fellow of the Hymn Society in the United States and Canada. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988 See also ARFON (Minor)",

    "notes": "TERRA BEATA was originally a traditional English folk tune, a variant of which, entitled RUSPER, appeared in The English Hymnal in 1906. Franklin L. Sheppard (b. Philadelphia, PA, 1852; d. Germantown, PA, 1930) arranged the tune for Babcock's text and published it in the Presbyterian church school hymnal Alleluia (1915), edited by Sheppard (Babcock and Sheppard were friends). After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Sheppard entered the family foundry business in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1875. He was organist at Zion Episcopal Church and later was an elder and music director of the Second Presbyterian Church in Baltimore. President of the Presbyterian Board of Publications, Sheppard also served on the committee that prepared the Presbyterian Hymnal of 1911. In the history of hymnody he is remembered primarily for arranging the tune TERRA BEATA for “This Is My Father's World.” TERRA BEATA (also called TERRA PATRIS) is Latin for \"beautiful world.\" A lively melody with an extended range, the tune requires a light manner of performance as well as light accompaniment. Try using guitars and recorders. Harmony singing is fine as long as voices stay light and energetic. Organists, choose light and bright foundation stops, not heavy diapasons. Easily learned by children, this is a vivacious hymn that would be hampered by plodding or weightiness. Observe a ritard only on the last line of stanza 3. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook",

    "notes": "LIVING FOR JESUS is a gospel hymn tune distinguishable by its dactylic rhythm for the stanzas and its straightforward iambic refrain. The guitar chords avoid some of the chromaticism of the original harmony; when using guitar, do not use keyboard. Singing the refrain only once–at the end of stanza 3–will constitute a fine climax. Singers may want to observe a ritardando or a fermata in the final phrase of the refrain. C. Harold Lowden (b. Burlington, NJ, 1883; d. Collingwood, NJ, 1963) wrote his first songs when he was only twelve years old. He continued to write hymns for the rest of his life and edited a number of hymnals. A musical editor for the Evangelical and Reformed Church board, Lowden taught music at the Bible Institute of Pennsylvania (now Philadelphia College of Bible). He capped his career by serving for twenty-eight years, until his retirement in 1961, as minister of music of the Linden Baptist Church in Camden, New Jersey. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

For that festival, which celebrated the three-hundredth anniversary of the Reformation in England, the tune was set to Reginald Heber's ( PHH 249 ) “From Greenland's Icy Mountains.” First printed in leaflets, LANCASHIRE was published In Smart's Psalms and Hymns for Divine Worship (1867). It was set to Shurtleffs text in the 1905 Methodist Hymnal . In some hymnals this tune is associated with \"The Day of Resurrection\" (390). Initially cast over a static bass, LANCASHIRE becomes quite animated in its third phrase. Sing and accompany with much energy and rhythmic vitality. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "VENI IMMANUEL was originally music for a Requiem Mass in a fifteenth-century French Franciscan Processional. Thomas Helmore (b. Kidderminster, Worcestershire, England, 1811; d. Westminster, London, England, 1890) adapted this chant tune and published it in Part II of his The Hymnal Noted (1854). A graduate of Magdalen College, Oxford,England, Helmore was ordained a priest in the Church of England, but his main contribution to the church was in music. He was precentor at St. Mark's College, Chelsea (1842-1877), and master of the choristers in the Chapel Royal for many years. He promoted unaccompanied choral services and played an important part in the revival of plainchant in the Anglican Church. Helmore was involved in various publications of hymns, chants, and carols, including A Manual of Plainsong (1850) and The Hymnal Noted (with John Mason Neale). VENI IMMANUEL is in the Dorian mode and could be sung in harmony throughout, but the preferred practice is to sing the stanzas in unison and the refrain in parts. For example, sing the hymn antiphonally, perhaps including organ-alone stanzas. On stanza 4 the organ could play an arrangement of the tune while the congregation meditates on the text. Chant tunes are intended to be sung in speech-rhythm, so sing this hymn freely and do not hesitate to let the \"Rejoice\" phrases ring through the church! Use light accompaniment on the stanzas and full, bright accompaniment on the refrain. Play and sing the line \"Immanuel shall come to you\" as one phrase. Organists may want to use an accompaniment in more of a chant style; for example, Hymnal 1982 (56) contains an accompaniment suited to unison singing of the stanzas. Accompanists could still use the Psalter Hymnal harmonization for part singing on the refrain. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook",

    "notes": "Composed by William Penfro Rowlands (b. Maenclochog, Pembrokeshire, Wales, 1860; d. Swansea, Glamorganshire, Wales, 1937) during the Welsh revival of 1904-1905, BLAENWERN was published in Henry H. Jones's Cân a Moliant (1915). The tune's name refers to a farm in Pembroke shire where Rowlands convalesced in his youth. A church musician of many talents, Rowlands was a teacher in several schools. He composed hymn tunes and anthems and was conductor of the famous Morriston United Choral Society of southern Wales and precentor of the Tabernacle Congregational Church in Morriston. BLAENWERN gained its current popularity through Billy Graham crusades when it was sung to \"What a Friend We Have in Jesus\" (579). Play this majestic music with two broad beats per measure. Especially when sung with its fine harmonization, BLAENWERN gradually builds to a powerful climax at the end of phrase 3 and the beginning of phrase 4. Assign some stanzas for antiphonal singing in harmony, but have the entire group sing stanza 5 in unison, perhaps with a slightly slower tempo. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "John Sebastian Bach Hodges (b. Bristol, Gloucestershire, England, 1830; d. Baltimore, MD, 1915) composed EUCHARISTIC HYMN for Heber's text in 1868, while he was rector at Grace Episcopal Church, Newark, New Jersey. He first published the tune in his Book of Common Praise (1869) and named it after the sacramental service for which Heber wrote the text. Sing EUCHARISTIC HYMN in harmony, preferably without accompaniment and always in its entirety. It also makes a fine communion motet for a choir. The son of Edward Hodges ( PHH 55 ), John came to the United States at the age of fifteen. Educated at Columbia University, New York City, and General Theological Seminary, New York City, he was ordained in 1855. After having served Episcopal churches in Pittsburgh, Chicago, and Newark, he devoted the remainder of his career to St. Paul Church in Baltimore (1870-1906). There Hodges replaced the mixed choir with a choir of men and boys. He composed over a hundred hymns and anthems and compiled The Book of Common Praise (1869) and the revised edition of Hymn Tunes (1903). He was also active on the committees that produced the Episcopal Hymnal (1874) and Hymnal (1892). Since the publication of William Mercer's Church Psalter and Hymn Book (1854), many hymnals have set Heber's text to GENEVAN 98/118 (see 98, 118, or 314) in one long stanza. That tune–much loved in the Reformed tradition–is a useful alternate because it helps to bind together the two short stanzas into one longer prayer. To create a longer Lord's Supper hymn, combine 310 and 314 into one song or choral anthem using GENEVAN 98/118. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook",

Bradbury ( PHH 114 ) composed SOLID ROCK in 1863 for Edward Mote's \"My Hope Is Built on Nothing Less.\" The tune name derives from that song's refrain: \"On Christ, the solid rock, I stand. . . .” Bradbury published SOLID ROCK in his 1864 children's collection The Golden Censor. The tune exhibits a bar form (AAB) with a coda added to its final line, allowing a repeat of the final phrase in the versification. The final line was originally the refrain line in Mote's gospel hymn. SOLID ROCK is well-suited to singing in harmony; festival use of instruments other than organ heightens the thanksgiving mood of the psalm text. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "Dmitri Stephanovich Bortnianski (b. Gloukoff, Ukraine, 1751; d. St. Petersburg, Russia, 1825) was a Russian composer of church music, operas, and instrumental music. His tune ST. PETERSBURG (also known as RUSSIAN HYMN) was first published in J. H. Tscherlitzky's Choralbuch (1825). The tune is supposedly from a Mass composed in 1822, though that work is not extant. Tchaikovsky included ST. PETERSBURG as the setting for a Russian hymn in his 1884 edition of Bortnianski's compositions for church use. The tune is named after the city where Bortnianski studied, worked, and died. Shaped in to a strict bar form (AAB), this tune has a third line that brings a fine climax and resolution to the entire melody. Bortnianski began his musical study as a chorister in the imperial chapel choir at the age of eight. With financial aid from Catherine the Great, he went to Venice in 1768 to study music; he also studied in Rome and Naples. After returning to Russia, he assumed the directorship of the imperial chapel choir in St. Petersburg. His choral music was published by Tchaikovsky (c. 1884) and continues to be used both in the Russian Orthodox Church and in western churches. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1987",

The 1564 harmonization by Claude Goudimel ( PHH 6 ) originally placed the melody in the tenor. An alternate harmonization with descants by Johann Crüger ( PHH 42 ) can be found opposite 41 in the Psalter Hymnal . (See also notes at PHH 42 .) Since the character of Isaiah 40 is very different from the lament of Psalm 42, for which the tune was written, the tempo should be faster here than at 42. Sing with a buoyant and lilting rhythm. Organists will find preludes to this tune under GENEVAN 42 in Dutch works or under FREU DICH SEHR in German works. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "WONDROUS LOVE was first set to this text in William Walker's (PsH 44) second edition of Southern Harmony (1840). Publication of the hymn in B. F. White's The Sacred Harp (1844) further promoted the combination of text and tune. The meter of \"What Wondrous Love\" derives from an old English ballad about the infamous pirate Captain Kidd: My name was Robert Kidd, when I sailed, when I sailed; My name was Robert Kidd, when I sailed; My name was Robert Kidd, God's laws I did forbid, So wickedly I did when I sailed, when I sailed So wickedly I did when I sailed. Described by Erik Routley (PHH 31) as \"incomparably beautiful,\" the tune is in ABA form and in Dorian or Aeolian mode (depending on which version is used or which \"authentic\" performance is heard). The setting is by Emily R. Brink (PHH 158). The Hymnal 1982 (439) includes the original three-part setting with the melody in the tenor; that setting could be useful for choirs alternating with the congregation on the hymnal setting. Sing unaccompanied, or use light accompaniment for stanzas 1 and 2, gradually becoming more forceful through stanza 3, and use full organ (or piano) for stanza 4. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1987 WONDROUS LOVE appeared in Walker's fourth edition of Southern Harmony (1840) where the arrangement was attributed to James Christopher, 1813-1844.

    "notes": "Though no firm documentation exists, ST. ANNE was probably composed by William Croft ( PHH 149 ), possibly when he was organist from 1700-1711 at St. Anne's Church in Soho, London, England. (According to tradition, St. Anne was the mother of the Virgin Mary.) The tune was first published in A Supplement to the New Version (6th ed., 1708) as a setting for Psalm 42. ST. ANNE became a setting for \"O God, Our Help in Ages Past\" in Hymns Ancient and Modern (1861), and the two have been inseparable ever since. ST. ANNE shares its first melodic motif with a number of other tunes from the early eighteenth century; one example is Bach's great fugue in E-flat, nicknamed \"St. Anne,\" though it uses only the first motif of ST. ANNE. The original \"gathering notes\" (where the first note of each phrase is doubled in length) have been changed to equal the tune's prevailing quarter-note rhythms. ST. ANNE is a strong tune that must not be sung too rapidly. On the final stanza, sing in a stately manner and try unison singing on the alternative accompaniment by David Johnson ( PHH 433 ), which was first published in Free Organ Accompaniments to Festival Hymns, Vol. 1 (1963). -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook",

Beecher's Plymouth Collection , 1855; Leonard Bacon's Church Music , 1855) show that Allen was the author/adapter of the text \"Must Jesus bear the cross alone,\" not the composer of the tune. The tune itself was printed without attribution for many years. MAITLAND is also sometimes attributed to the Oberlin Social and Sabbath School Hymn Book , which Allen edited, but this collection did not contain music.

    "notes": "ST. MATTHEW was published in the Supplement to the New Version of Psalms by Dr. Brady and Mr. Tate (1708), where it was set to Psalm 33 and noted as a new tune. The editor of the Supplement, William Croft ( PHH 149 ), may be the composer of ST. MATTHEW. One of the longer British psalm tunes, it has a fine mix of larger and stepwise intervals. It bears forceful or even jubilant singing with one broad beat per measure. If taken at a brisk tempo (c. dotted half = 50), consider holding the last note of every long phrase an extra measure to provide a breathing space between sentences. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "WAS GOTT TUT is usually attributed to Severus Gastorius (b. Ottern, near Weimar, Germany, 1646; d. Jena, Germany, 1682), who presumably composed the tune during a convalescence in 1675 (see above). The tune was published in Ausserlesenes Weimarisches Gesangbuch (1681). Educated at the University of Jena, Gastorius became cantor of Jena in 1677, a post he held until his death. He wrote a variety of church music, including five funeral motets, but he is known primarily for composing WAS GOTT TUT. The tune is a classic example of a seventeenth-century German chorale setting in bar form (AAB). Sing in sturdy unison, changing to harmony for some of the stanzas. Do not rush, but sing with stately fervor. Observing fermatas at the ends of the first two 1 long lines will help to bring a sense of patience to this melody by giving more breathing time. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook",

    "notes": "Said to be a \"Greek Air,\" CALCUTTA was one of the popular national tunes used by Dublin's Thomas Moore (1779-1852) in his Sacred Songs (1816). Arthur S. Sullivan ( PHH 46 ) adapted it for congregational singing and published it in his Church Hymns with Tunes (1874). [The tune was earlier adapted for congregational singing in the tune LORAINE in Lowell Mason's and George Webb's The Psaltery (1845) and in the tune MILLENIUM SONG in Thomas Hastings and William B. Bradbury's The New York Choralist (1847)] The tune is named CALCUTTA because of its association with \"From Greenland's Icy Mountains,\" a text by Reginald Heber ( PHH 249 ), who was the Anglican bishop of Calcutta at the time of his death. CALCUTTA is a bar form (AAB) with a harmonization that invites part singing. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "LYNGHAM is a fuguing tune by Thomas Jarman (b. Clipston, Northamptonshire, England, 1776; d. Clipston, 1862), published in his Sacred Music (around 1803). Jarman was a tailor by vocation, but he much preferred his musical avocation. He composed many hymn tunes, which were published in seventeen collections, including The Northamptonshire Harmony (1826), as well as in The Wesleyan Methodist periodical. Jarman was a popular choral director at the Clipston Baptist Chapel and at music festivals in neighboring villages. Typical of fuguing tunes, LYNGHAM begins chordally and then moves to imitative lines that require part singing as well as repetition of some of the textual phrases. The tune has also been effectively set to \"Oh, for a Thousand Tongues to Sing\" (501). The tune works well for choral singing and for congregational singing in parts. The rhythmic vitality of the music needs brisk organ accompaniment, but keep the accompaniment light as well as vigorous! -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

When the Franco-Prussian War broke out in 1870, Gounod left his native Paris and settled in England for five years. This sturdy tune was published in the Scottish Hymnary in 1872. It uses several melodic sequences and builds to a climax in its last line. Sing in parts throughout with moderate to strong accompaniment. RATISBON, the suggested alternate tune, is found with this text in many other hymnals, but its isorhythmic (all equal rhythms) shape doesn't fit this text as well as Gounod's livelier LUX PRIMA. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "MORECAMBE was composed in 1870 by Frederick C. Atkinson (b. Norwich, England, 1841; d. East Dereham, England, 1896) as a setting for Henry Lyte's \"Abide with Me\" (442). It was first published in G. S. Barrett and E.J. Hopkins's Congregational Church Hymnal (1887). The tune is named for a coastal town on Morecambe Bay near Lancaster, England, a town not far from Bradford, where Atkinson served as organist. As a boy Atkinson was a chorister and assistant organist at Norwich Cathedral. In 1867 he graduated with a Bachelor of Music degree from Cambridge and then served as organist and choirmaster in St. Luke's Church, Manningham, Bradford. He also held that position at Norwich Cathedral and at St. Mary's Parish Church in Lewisham. Atkinson wrote hymn tunes, anthems, and complete Anglican services, as well as songs and piano pieces. MORECAMBE has a good melodic contour and a strong rise to its climax but then concludes rather weakly. (See comments on the generic group of tunes that includes MORECAMBE at PHH 276 .) Try singing this fervent prayer to MORESTEAD (295), a tune with a very different character that will shed new light on the text. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "Jabusch wrote his text to correspond to PROMISED ONE, an Israeli folk tune. Probably of Hasidic origin, PROMISED ONE was associated with the folk song \"Gilu Hagalilim,\" brought by Zionist settlers to Israel after World War I. The Fireside Book of Folk Songs (1947) contains the tune with a different text but with the \"Lift up your voices\" phrase in its refrain. This joyful minor tune has the syncopated rhythm associated with the Jewish hora dance and derives its melodic phrases from variations of the first line. PROMISED ONE is an exciting tune intended to be sung with perpetual energy and without pauses between refrain and stanza and refrain. Sing in unison and try using a faster tempo for each succeeding stanza. Accompany with guitar, various percussion instruments, hand clapping and/or Orff instruments on the ostinati patterns or improvise similar patterns. Try adding a simple descant for the final two measures of the refrain by going up the scale as follows. B, C-sharp, D-sharp, E, E. John Ferguson (b. Cleveland, OH, 1941) prepared the setting for Advent services at the United Church of Christ, Kent, Ohio, in 1973. That setting was published the following year in the UCC's Hymnal , of which Ferguson was music editor. Known for his skill as a music clinician and for his organ concerts and improvisations, Ferguson has devoted much of his professional life to church music. He was educated at Oberlin College, Kent State University, and the Eastman School of Music, where he received a Doctor of Musical Arts in 1976. From 1965 to 1978 he was professor of music at Kent State University and organist and choirmaster at the United Church of Christ. He served as music director and organist at Central Lutheran Church in Minneapolis, Minnesota, from 1978 to 1983. Since 1983 Ferguson has been professor of church music and organ at St. Olaf College, Northfield, Minnesota. He has published numerous choral anthems and hymn arrangements for organ and issued various recordings of hymn festivals. His published works include A Musician's Guide to Church Music (1981) and Worship Blueprints: Guide to Planning Warship Music (1983). -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook",

    "notes": "NUN KOMM DER HEIDEN HEILAND is a chorale derived from a chant. Among the simplest of the Lutheran repertoire, it is framed by identical lines–l and 4. Sing the entire hymn with antiphonal groups (the practice its original Latin author, Ambrose, strongly promoted). Sing some stanzas in unison and others in harmony. Always reserve stanza 7, the doxology, for a strong unison with full accompaniment. Play this music in two long lines to match the couplet structure of the textual lines. The tune dates from a twelfth- or thirteenth-century Einsiedeln manuscript. Presumably by Johann Walther ( PHH 398 ), the adaptation of the tune was published in the 1524 Erfurt Enchiridia . Johann S. Bach ( PHH 7 ) used the tune for preludes in the Clavierübung and Orgelbüchlein and in his cantatas 36 and 62. The harmonization in the Psalter Hymnal comes from Seth Calvisius's Hymni Sacri (1594). Originally named Seth Kalwitz, Calvisius (b. Gorsleben, Thuringia, Germany, 1556; d. Leipzig, Germany, 1615) became known as the leading music theoretician of his time. He was educated at the universities of Helmstedt and Leipzig and spent much of his life teaching and writing about music history and theory. He taught at the Fürstenschule in Schulpforta from 1582 to 1594 and at the University of Leipzig from 1594 until his death. He also served as cantor at several churches. In addition to his theoretical work, Calvisius wrote psalm and hymn tunes and anthems, and he edited the first hymn book published in Leipzig, Harmonia cantionum ecclesiasticarum (1597). -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook",

    "notes": "WIR PFLÜGEN (named after the incipit of Schulz’s original third stanza) was published anonymously in the Hanover collection Lieder für Volksschulen (1800). But it was credited to Johann A. P. Schulz in Lindner’s Berlin songbook Jungenfreund (1812). The harmonization by John B. Dykes ( PHH 147 ) was first published in the 1861 edition of Hymns Ancient and Modern . The tune is noted for its opening phrase, which encompasses a very wide range, but that doesn’t appear to discourage most congregations from singing it. Sing the stanzas in unison (note that lines 1 and 4 are unison) and the refrain in harmony. Change the organ registration before stanza 3 to highlight the change of focus in the text: as we sing stanzas 1 and 2, we address each other, but in stanza 3 we address God. Johann Abraham Peter Schulz (b. Lunebirg, Germany, 1747; d. Schwedt and der Oder, Germany, 1800) had a distinguished career in music, though his father wanted him to become a pastor. At the age of fifteen Schulz traveled to Berlin by himself to seek out a good music teacher. He persevered in his musical training under the composer and theorist Johann Philipp Kirnberger. Appointed accompanist and music teacher to the Polish princess Sophia Woiwodin in 1768, Schulz traveled all through Europe and was exposed to many different kinds of music. After1775 he had a number of prestigious positions, including director of the Royal French Theater in Berlin (1776-1780), director of music for Prince Henry of Prussia (1780-1787), and the director of the Royal Danish Theater (1787-1795). Schulz composed operas, instrumental works, church music, and song settings in a folk-music style, often setting the poems of great literary figures to music. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "Melchior Vulpius (b. Wasungen, Henneberg, Germany, c. 1570; d. Weimar, Germany, 1615) composed this tune as a setting for Michael Weisse's hymn \"Gelobt sei Gott in höchsten Thron.\" Weisse's text was published with the tune in Vulpius's Ein Schon Geistlich Gesangbuch (1609). Because the text dates from the early sixteenth century, some scholars think the tune may have older roots. Born into a poor family named Fuchs, Vulpius had only limited educational opportunities and did not attend the university. He taught Latin in the school in Schleusingen, where he Latinized his surname, and from 1596 until his death served as a Lutheran cantor and teacher in Weimar. A distinguished composer, Vulpius wrote a St. Matthew Passion (1613), nearly two hundred motets in German and Latin, and over four hundred hymn tunes, many of which became popular in Lutheran churches, and some of which introduced the lively Italian balletto rhythms into the German hymn tunes. His music was published in Cantiones Sacrae (1602, 1604), Kirchengesangund Geistliche Lieder (1604, enlarged as Ein schon geistlich Gesanglmch , 1609), and posthumous¬ly in Cantionale Sacrum (1646). An exuberant tune, GELOBT SEI GOTT (also known as VULPIUS) is in triple meter. It reveals a Baroque playfulness in the syncopations in lines 2 and 3. Although the refrain is barred in triple meter, Germans would have sung it in duple meter with an accent on the second syllable of \"alleluia.\" Sing in unison or in parts. Try an antiphonal performance in which the choir or antiphonal groups sing the stanzas and the congregation sings the refrain. Choir sopranos could sing the descant by Emily R. Brink ( PHH 158 ) on the refrain. Try also to sing one of the middle stanzas unaccompanied. Use strong, rhythmically precise organ accompaniment, especially on the cadences in phrases 2 and 3. On an average Sunday C major is a suitable key, but try D major on Easter Sunday or other festive days because that key is brighter. \"Good Christians All\" is also a wonderful piece for a brass choir. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "Also known as: WAS FRAG ICH NACH DER WELT O GOTT DU FROMMER GOTT Composed by Ahasuerus Fritsch (b. Mücheln on the Geissel, near Merseburg, Germany, 1629; d. Rudolstadt, Germany, 1701), DARMSTADT first appeared in his Himmels-Lust und Welt-Unlust (1679). The melody was altered when it was published in the 1698 Darmstadt Geistreiches Gesangbuch and in several other eighteenth-century German hymnals. The tune is also known as O GOTT, DU FROMMER GOTT (named after the Heermann text) and as WAS FRAG ICH NACH DER WELT (named after an association with a text in the Darmstadt hymnal). Fritsch grew up during the turbulent time of the Thirty Years' War, and his family was often forced to flee for their lives. He was educated at the University of Jena and later became chancellor of that university. He also served as president of the church's consistory in Rudolstadt and edited two collections of hymns. The harmonization comes from Cantata 45 by Johann S. Bach ( PHH 7 ); he also used the tune in cantatas 64, 94, and 133. This noble tune has short phrases that should be sung in four long lines; observe small fermatas at the end of each of the first two lines. Use solid organ tone to support congregational singing in unison or in parts. Keep the energy lively. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1989",

    "notes": "BETHANY, named after the village near Jerusalem, is a suitably dramatic tune for the song text. It was composed by Henry Smart (b. Marylebone, London, England, 1813; d. Hampstead, London, 1879), a capable composer of church music who wrote some very fine hymn tunes (REGENT SQUARE, 354, is the best-known). He originally composed BETHANY for the text “Jesus, I My Cross Have Taken”; it was first published in Psalms and Hymns for Divine Worship (1867). Though Smart favored unison singing, which works well, especially with all the stops pulled out and the tempo increased on stanza 2, the harmonization is quite accessible to part singing. ( Note : this BETHANY should not be confused with one composed by Lowell Mason in 1856 and first published as a setting for \"Nearer, My God, to Thee.\") Smart gave up a career in the legal profession for one in music. Although largely self taught, he became proficient in organ playing and composition, and he was a music teacher and critic. Organist in a number of London churches, including St. Luke's, Old Street (1844-1864), and St. Pancras (1864-1869), Smart was famous for his extemporizations and for his accompaniment of congregational singing. He became completely blind at the age of fifty-two, but his remarkable memory enabled him to continue playing the organ. Fascinated by organs as a youth, Smart designed organs for important places such as St. Andrew Hall in Glasgow and the Town Hall in Leeds. He composed an opera, oratorios, part-songs, some instrumental music, and many hymn tunes, as well as a large number of works for organ and choir. He edited the Choralebook (1858), the English Presbyterian Psalms and Hymns for Divine Worship (1867), and the Scottish Presbyterian Hymnal (1875). Some of his hymn tunes were first published in Hymns Ancient and Modern (1861). -- Psalter Hymnal Hadnbook , 1988",

A typical gospel hymn tune, EL NATHAN is constructed with a few melodic lines and a very simple harmony, but it is marked by some rhythmic interest. The tune is easily sung in parts. Try singing the stanzas in two long lines. The text of the refrain calls for one long extended phrase; accompanists and choirs using staggered breathing can demonstrate the effectiveness of a musical “communion of the saints” by performing the entire refrain without a break. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1989",

    "notes": "O WALY WALY is a traditional English melody associated with the song \"O Waly, Waly, gin love be bony,\" the words of which date back at least to Ramsay's Tea Table Miscellany (1724-1732), and as the setting for a folk ballad about Jamie Douglas. It is also well known in the Appalachian region of the United States. Hal H. Hopson (b. White Mound, TX, 1933) adapted and arranged O WALY WALY as an anthem in 1971 for his setting of 1 Corinthians 13, \"Gift of Love\"; his version became known as GIFT OF LOVE. That copyrighted version of the tune can be sung in canon after one measure, especially on the \"refrain\" stanzas (2 and 4) and ideally by the choir or by a small part of the congregation, somewhat in the manner of a descant. Keep the phrases moving to help create four lines instead of eight choppy phrases. In fact, the tune has a difficult time when not sung in canon; more recent hymnals have begun publishing this tune in triple meter, contrary to the publisher's request, in order to avoid the long-held notes. (The Companion to the United Methodist Hymnal noted that their committee's request for permission to use triple meter was denied, but that \"in an assertion of free will over predestination, The Presbyterian Hymnal, 1990, included the text with a triple-meter form of the tune,\" p. 636.) Hopson was educated at Baylor University, Waco, Texas, and Southern Baptist Seminary, Louisville, Kentucky. He served various churches in the Nashville area as organist and choir director. He has also taught at Westminster Choir College, Princeton, New Jersey, and Scarritt Graduate School, Nashville, Tennessee. Over eight hundred of Hopson's hymn tunes and keyboard and choral compositions have been published. He takes an active role in many conferences and music clinics and was a major contributor to the Presbyterian Psalter (1994). -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook",

    "notes": "Charles V. Stanford (b. Dublin, Ireland, 1852; d. Marylebone, London, England, 1924) composed ENGELBERG as a setting for William W. How's \"For All the Saints\" (505). The tune was published in the 1904 edition of Hymns Ancient and Modern with no less than six different musical settings. It is clearly a fine congregational hymn but also a stunning choral anthem when used with some of the additional settings that Stanford supplied. ENGELBERG is an attractive, energetic melody with many ascending motives, designed for unison singing with no pauses between stanzas. Try using other instruments in addition to organ (as stanza 5 suggests). Accompanists could play the third and fourth stanzas in a more subdued manner and then play the climactic final stanza with great strength and vigor. A distinguished composer and teacher of composition, Stanford began his musical career at an early age. Before the age of ten he had composed several pieces and given piano recitals of works by Handel and Bach. He studied at Queen's College, Cambridge, England, as well as in Leipzig and Berlin. At the age of twenty-one he was asked to become organist at the famous Trinity College, Cambridge. At that time he also began a prestigious career in conducting, which included appearances with the London Bach Choir from 1885 to 1902, and he traveled widely in England, Europe, and the United States. His teaching career was equally impressive. Stanford taught composition at both the Royal College of Music and Cambridge University; among his students were Ralph Vaughan Williams ( PHH 316 ) and Gustav Holst. He was knighted in 1902. Stanford wrote over two hundred compositions in nearly all musical genres, including symphonies, operas, chamber music, and songs. Most notable in his church music are several complete services, anthems, and unison hymn tunes. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook",

Llanddoget, Denbighshire, North Wales, 1885) was educated at Jesus College, Oxford, England, and ordained an Anglican priest in 1833. He served parishes in Rhosymedre and Llanddoget and published a collection of hymn tunes, Original Sacred Music (2 vols., 1836, 1843), for use in Anglican churches in Wales. RHOSYMEDRE was published in the 1836 collection. The tune's title is derived from the Welsh parish where Edwards was pastor for some years after 1843. In Wales this tune is associated with Easter and is thought of as a jubilant hymn tune. Outside of Wales, however, it often receives a more devotional treatment. RHOSYMEDRE is characterized by mainly stepwise motion and by repeated tones. It is a bar form tune (AAB). Sing this fine harmonization in parts. Use firm accompaniment, and play at a moderate pace. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

London, England, 1896) composed LAUDES DOMINI for this text [When morning gilds the skies] Tune and text were published together in the 1868 Appendix to Hymns Ancient and Modern and they have been inseparable ever since. An accomplished and popular choral director in England, Barnby showed his musical genius early: he was an organist and choirmaster at the age of twelve. He became organist at St. Andrews, Wells Street, London, where he developed an outstanding choral program (at times nicknamed \"the Sunday Opera\"). Barnby introduced annual performances of J. S. Bach's St. John Passion in St. Anne's, Soho, and directed the first performance in an English church of the St. Matthew Passion . He was also active in regional music festivals, conducted the Royal Choral Society, and composed and edited music (mainly for Novello and Company). In 1892 he was knighted by Queen Victoria. His compositions include many anthems and service music for the Anglican liturgy, as well as 246 hymn tunes (published posthumously in 1897). He edited four hymnals, including The Hymnary (1872) and The Congregational Sunday School Hymnal (1891), and coedited The Cathedral Psalter (1873). LAUDES DOMINI is one of Barnby's better tunes; many others have been forgotten or charitably retired by hymnal committees. The tune's Latin title, which means \"the praises of the Lord,\" is derived from the litany refrain. LAUDES DOMINI's most notable element is its built-in retard in the final phrase. Sing the stanzas in antiphonal fashion but have the entire congregation sing the refrain. Use strong organ accompaniment with a bit more stately tempo on the fifth stanza. Do not add any further ritardando to the final phrase; the composer has already provided it. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "GENEVAN 3 is the first of some fourteen tunes in the Psalter Hymnal credited to Louis Bourgeois (b. Paris, France, c. 1510; d. Paris, 1561), who was the primary musical editor of the Genevan Psalter. In both his early and later years Bourgeois wrote French songs to entertain the rich, but in the history of church music he is known especially for his contribution to the Genevan Psalter. Apparently moving to Geneva in 1541, the same year John Calvin returned to Geneva from Strasbourg, Bourgeois served as cantor and master of the choristers at both St. Pierre and St. Gervais, which is to say he was music director there under the pastoral leadership of Calvin. Bourgeois used the choristers to teach the new psalm tunes to the congregation. The extent of Bourgeois's involvement in the Genevan Psalter is a matter of scholarly debate. Calvin had published several partial psalters, including one in Strasbourg in 1539 and another in Geneva in 1542, with melodies by unknown composers. In 1551 another French psalter appeared in Geneva, Eighty-three Psalms of David , with texts by Marot and de Beze, and with most of the melodies by Bourgeois, who supplied thirty four original tunes and thirty-six revisions of older tunes. This edition was republished repeatedly, and later Bourgeois's tunes were incorporated into the complete Genevan Psalter (1562). However, his revision of some older tunes was not uniformly appreciated by those who were familiar with the original versions; he was actually imprisoned overnight for some of his musical arrangements but freed after Calvin's intervention. In addition to his contribution to the 1551 Psalter, Bourgeois produced a four-part harmonization of fifty psalms, published in Lyons (1547, enlarged 1554), and wrote a textbook on singing and sight-reading, La Droit Chemin de Musique (1550). He left Geneva in 1552 and lived in Lyons and Paris for the remainder of his life. GENEVAN 3 was first published in the 1551 edition of the Genevan Psalter to Clement Marot's text for Psalm 3, \"0 Seigneur que de gens,\" which is sometimes used as a tune name. In the Anglo-Genevan Psalter of 1561 the tune became the setting for Psalm 122 as well and is therefore also known as OLD 122ND. In 1899 Robert Bridges chose this tune for his translation of \"When Morning Gilds the Sky\" (438); that combination is still found in some hymnals. In Ionian mode (major), this Genevan tune has no repetitions in its melodic structure. However, its regular rhythmic pattern helps to make it accessible; each group of three short phrases forms longer units, thereby making four long lines in the melody. Howard J. Slenk (b. Holland, MI, 1931) provided the harmonization. Slenk received his undergraduate education from Calvin College and his Ph.D. from Ohio State University in Columbus; his dissertation was entitled The Huguenot Psalter in the Low Countries . He taught at Trinity Christian College in Palos Heights, Illinois, and at Calvin College from 1967 until retiring in 1995. From 1970 to 1993 Slenk served as organist and director of music at Woodlawn Christian Reformed Church in Grand Rapids. His published works include A Well-Appointed Church Music (1960) and various articles on Genevan psalmody, including the article on page 28. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "Composed by George J. Elvey ( PHH 48 ) in 1862 for 'Just as I Am, without One Plea\" (263), ST. CRISPIN was first published in the 1863 edition of Edward Thorne's Selection of Psalm and Hymn Tunes . The tune title honors a third-century Roman martyr, Crispin, who, along with Crispinian, preached in Gaul (modern-day France); these two missionaries are the patron saints of shoemakers and leather workers. ST. CRISPIN has an attractive melodic contour. Its repeated notes are typical of other \"generic\" British hymn tunes from the later nineteenth century (for example, QUEBEC, 141,307; PENTECOST, 212; MORECAMBE, 419; and MARYTON, 573). Sing it in harmony, perhaps unaccompanied on one of the inner stanzas. The parallel structure of the text also invites singing stanzas in alternation between either men or women or two sides of the congregation. -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook",

    "notes": "LAUDATE DOMINUM (Latin words for the opening phrase of Psalm 150) comes from the end of the anthem \"Hear My Words, O Ye People\" by C. Hubert H. Parry ( PHH 145 ), an anthem he composed in 1894 for a festival of the Salisbury Diocesan Choral Association. Parry's tune was set to Baker's text in the 1916 Supplement of Hymns Ancient and Modern , replacing an earlier LAUDATE DOMINUM by Henry J. Gauntlett for Baker's text. Parry's tune is an inspired melody from a great tune writer who rarely came to church but who produced some of the best hymn tunes in the later Victorian era. Sing this noble tune with vigor and excitement; accompany it on the organ with a full registration and a touch of marcato. Sing stanza 1 in unison, stanzas 2 and 3 in parts (possibly one of them unaccompanied), and stanza 4 in unison again. For a real treat use Parry's majestic alternate harmonization with a \"walking bass\" on the final stanza; that harmonization is found in The Hymnal 1982 (432) and requires a slower tempo (half note = 88). -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",

    "notes": "Henry John Gauntlett (b. Wellington, Shropshire, England, 1805; d. Kensington, London, England, 1876) originally composed HOUGHTEN for the text \"O Worship the King\" (428). Sing the theme stanza (st. 1) in parts and the other stanzas in unison, or vice versa. When singing the entire psalm, sing stanzas 2 through 13 antiphonally. Singing of only part of the psalm should always include the theme stanza. When he was nine years old, Gauntlett became organist at his father's church in Olney, Buckinghamshire. At his father's insistence he studied law, practicing it until 1844, after which he chose to devote the rest of his life to music. He was an organist in various churches in the London area and became an important figure in the history of British pipe organs. A designer of organs for William Hill's company, Gauntlett extend¬ed the organ pedal range and in 1851 took out a patent on electric action for organs. Felix Mendelssohn chose him to play the organ part at the first performance of Elijah in Birmingham, England, in 1846. Gauntlett is said to have composed some ten thousand hymn tunes, most of which have been forgotten. A number of them, including HOUGHTEN (1861), were first published in various editions of The Congregational Psalmist (1858-1886). A supporter of the use of plainchant in the church, Gauntlett published the Gregorian Hymnal of Matins and Evensong (1844). -- Psalter Hymnal Handbook , 1988",
