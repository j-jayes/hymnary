## Data Source

::: {.attribution-banner}
**All hymn and tune data on this site is sourced from [Hymnary.org](https://hymnary.org/).**

Hymnary.org is a comprehensive index of hymns and hymnals, operated as a service of the [Calvin Institute of Christian Worship](https://worship.calvin.edu/) at Calvin University and the [Christian Classics Ethereal Library (CCEL)](https://www.ccel.org/).

We are deeply grateful for this incredible free resource that makes projects like this possible.

## Methodology

### Input Data

The organ hymn list comes from an **Allen organ console controller display**, which shows 182 built-in hymns by abbreviated name. Each abbreviation was mapped to its full hymn title.

Some hymns have **A/B variants** (e.g., "Away in a Manger - A" and "Away in a Manger - B"), indicating that the organ has two different tune settings for the same text. In these cases, we search once and present all matching tunes, sorted by prevalence.

### Scraping Process

For each of the 182 organ hymns:

1. **Search** — We queried `hymnary.org/search?qu={title}+in%3Atunes` to find tune matches.
2. **Tune detail** — For each tune found in search results, we fetched the full detail page at `hymnary.org/tune/{slug}`.
3. **Parse** — We extracted structured metadata using BeautifulSoup (Python) from the HTML:
   - Tune title, composer, place of origin
   - Meter pattern, melodic incipit, key signature
   - Copyright status, number of hymnal appearances
   - Associated texts and alternative tune settings
   - Historical notes where available

### Scraping Ethics

This scraper was designed to be **respectful** of hymnary.org's servers:

| Measure | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Request delay** | 15 seconds between every request (3× their robots.txt `Crawl-delay: 5`) |
| **Caching** | All HTML responses cached locally; pages fetched only once |
| **Resume support** | Pipeline checkpoints after every hymn; interrupted runs pick up seamlessly |
| **User-Agent** | Clearly identifies this as a personal church project |
| **robots.txt** | Verified compliance on 7 February 2026; only accesses allowed paths |

### Data Files

The processed data is available in the project repository:

- **`data/processed/hymn_tune_index.json`** — Master index mapping each organ hymn to all associated tunes with full metadata
- **`data/processed/tunes.json`** — Deduplicated tune dictionary keyed by slug
- **`data/processed/summary.csv`** — Flat table for easy analysis

## Hymn Book Crossover (Coming Soon)

The next phase of this project will cross-reference the organ hymns against the church's hymn book index to identify which hymns are available on both. Stay tuned.

## Technical Stack

- **Python 3.12** with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for package management
- **BeautifulSoup4** + **lxml** for HTML parsing
- **Pandas** for data processing
- **Quarto** for website generation
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting

## Contact

This project was built to help our church organist identify which built-in Allen organ hymns match the church hymn book. If you have questions or suggestions, please open an issue on the project's GitHub repository.
